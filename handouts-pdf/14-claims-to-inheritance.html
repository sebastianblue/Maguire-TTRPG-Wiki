        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note from Mr. Trism, Executor:</strong> "The will states that all eight must be present to claim the inheritance. None may claim it individually. You must prove yourselves worthy—though the nature of that proof is... unconventional. Madame Yackle's final request was that you 'break what binds' before dawn. I confess I do not fully understand her meaning."
    </div>

    <div class="note" style="margin-top: 0.2in; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); border-color: #333;">
        <strong>The Ninth Seat:</strong> At the dining table, there are nine chairs arranged in a circle. Eight bear the names of the heirs. The ninth—at the head of the table—remains empty, with no name card. For whom was it intended?
