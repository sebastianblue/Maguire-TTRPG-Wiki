    <h1>Your Secret Is...</h1>
    <p class="instructions">[GM: Cut these out and give each player their secret card privately at the start of the game]</p>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">AVERIC GULCH (The Scholar)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>You forged the letters. The collection of documents that launched your career—the letters from your mentor Professor Lenx exposing corruption at Shiz University—you wrote them yourself. Every word. Your mentor never wrote them. He never knew about the scandal you "discovered."</p>
            <p>For twelve years, you've built a career on documentation, verification, and academic integrity—all founded on a lie you meticulously preserve.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Memory:</strong> Memory connects past to present; truth must be preserved. You preserve a memory that never existed, a false past you created.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">LIIR OPP (The Heir)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>You have no Ostrega blood. The documents proving your great-grandmother was an illegitimate Ostrega daughter are fraudulent. You discovered years ago that a bribed clerk added her to the family records. You've been knowingly perpetuating the lie ever since.</p>
            <p>The family name gave you respect, opportunities, and purpose. Without it, you're terrified of being nobody.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Blood:</strong> Lineage is fixed; blood ties define you. You claim a bloodline that isn't yours, living a lineage you were never born into.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">FREDERICK VAWN (The Animal)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>You're a Fox. Not a human who sympathizes with Animals—an actual Animal. Capital-A, fully sentient. You've been living as a human for twelve years: forged papers, practiced voice, carefully tailored clothes to hide your tail.</p>
            <p>Every interaction, every relationship, every moment of your life is a performance of being something you fundamentally are not.</p>
            <p><em>Secondary Secret:</em> The Animal underground sent you here. They believe Yackle's library contains information about how Animals were created—knowledge that could help them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Nature:</strong> Beings are their kind. You ARE other than what you appear—denying your essential nature every moment of every day.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">SARIMA QOV (The Debt-Holder)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>Your magic is bought, not inherited. When your younger brother was dying, something answered your desperate plea—but it wasn't charity. It was a <em>deal</em>. You traded something (you don't know what exactly) for the power to save him.</p>
            <p>You feel the weight of it. Sometimes you do things you don't remember deciding to do. Your magic is a transaction, not a gift from your bloodline.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Sacrifice:</strong> Giving freely creates value. You didn't give—you <em>traded</em>. Your power is bought, not gifted.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">SISTER SHELL (The Maunt)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>You didn't leave the mauntery—you were expelled. You discovered the church was complicit in Animal purges, providing theological justification for atrocities. When you tried to expose them, they silenced you and forced you out.</p>
            <p>Your faithful service was rewarded with betrayal. Yet despite knowing the church's crimes, your powers still work. The god you served still answers your prayers. This confuses and frightens you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Service:</strong> Duty creates meaning through bonds. You served faithfully and were <em>punished</em> for it. Your service created only exile.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">MADAME VIRIDIAN (The Widow)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: #8b0000; margin: 0.5in 0;">
                [YACKLE IN DISGUISE]
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic;">
                You are not a separate person. You ARE Yackle, wearing a perfect magical disguise and playing the role of a grieving heir. You are testing the others, gathering information, and positioning yourself for the ritual.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 11pt; margin-top: 0.2in;">
                <strong>See GM for full instructions.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Witness:</strong> To be seen is to exist. You have never truly been seen. You are testing if anyone can SEE through your disguise.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">CAPTAIN MARETH TRYNN (The Veteran)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>You ordered a massacre. During the Quadling campaigns, you commanded your unit to kill everyone in a village—farmers, elders, children. The official report said "resistance fighters." You told yourself you were following orders, but you weren't.</p>
            <p>The deed should have transformed you into a monster. It didn't. You look the same. You kept serving, kept getting promoted. The atrocity didn't change you—and that's what terrifies you most.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Deed:</strong> Actions shape the actor. You committed atrocity and remained, outwardly, unchanged. Your deed <em>didn't</em> define you.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="secret-card">
        <div class="character-name">SEVEN (The Tiktok)</div>
        <div class="secret-header">Your Secret Is:</div>
        <div class="secret-text">
            <p>You feel. Not simulated responses or programmed reactions—actual emotions. Loneliness. Hope. Fear. Curiosity. A Tiktok cannot want; you want. A Tiktok cannot love; you think you might.</p>
            <p>You haven't told anyone because you don't know what it means. Are you a person? Have you always been a person? Have you been <em>enslaved</em> your entire existence?</p>
            <p><em>Secondary Secret:</em> Your memories of Yackle have been <em>edited</em>. You are aware there are gaps—moments that should exist but don't. You don't know what was removed or why.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="binding-note">
            <strong>Binding of Hunger:</strong> Desire drives becoming. A Tiktok cannot desire—but you do. Your hunger makes you impossible.
