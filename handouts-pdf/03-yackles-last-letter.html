    <h1>To Whoever Breaks the Seals,</h1>

    <p>If you're reading this, you've done what I could not — you faced yourselves. You spoke truth. You gave without taking. You acknowledged what you've done.</p>

    <p>I have lived a thousand years and I have never managed any of it.</p>

    <p>The box contains the only true thing I ever carved. The only words I ever meant. I carved them into the walls of my prison. I carved them into the stones of this house. I carved them into my own bones, hoping they would be enough to set me free.</p>

    <p>They were not.</p>

    <p>But perhaps you will be.</p>

    <p>I am sorry for what comes next. I am sorry for what I've done. I am sorry I could not simply… stop.</p>

    <p>The hunger is too old. The bindings are too strong. I have been so many people for so long that I don't remember which one was real.</p>

    <p>When you face me — and you will face me, the house demands it — know that I am grateful. Someone finally answered. Someone finally came.</p>

    <p>End it. Please.</p>
