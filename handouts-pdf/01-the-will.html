    <h1>The Last Will and Testament<br>of<br>Yackle Ostrega</h1>

    <p class="formal">Being of sound mind (debatable) and ancient body,<br>
    I hereby decree the following:</p>

    <p>To whomever arrives at my estate on the night of my passing, I leave everything.</p>

    <p>The house. The grounds. The contents therein. All possessions, all secrets, all debts and all honors of the Ostrega name — what remains of it.</p>

    <p>But you must prove yourselves worthy.</p>

    <p>The house contains Seven Seals, bound to the Eight Bindings that hold reality itself. Break all seven before dawn, and the inheritance is yours. Fail, and the house claims you instead.</p>

    <p>The seals will test you. They will know you. They will see what you have done and what you hide. There is no deceiving them. There is no cheating. There is only truth, or there is failure.</p>

    <p>I have left clues. I have left keys. I have left everything you need, if you are clever enough to see it.</p>

    <p>You have until dawn.</p>

    <p>Good luck. You will need it.</p>
