    <h1>A Servant's Guide to the House</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">For Training New Staff<br>— Willem, Head Butler</p>

    <h2>The Daily Round</h2>

    <p>The house must be served in proper order, as the Mistress requires. Begin at dawn and follow this sequence without deviation.</p>

    <p><strong>First: The CHAPEL.</strong> Light the morning candles, air the incense, open the prayer book to the day's reading. The spirit must be tended before the body.</p>

    <p><strong>Second: The KITCHEN.</strong> Stoke the fires, begin the bread, set water to boil. A house runs on its stomach.</p>

    <p><strong>Third: The LIBRARY.</strong> Open curtains, dust the reading desk, check that no books were left open overnight (the Mistress is particular about this). The mind awakens with the day.</p>

    <p><strong>Fourth: The PARLOR.</strong> Lay the fire (do not light — that is the Mistress's preference), plump cushions, wind the clock. Guests may arrive at any hour.</p>

    <p><strong>Fifth: The DINING ROOM.</strong> Polish the silver, set for breakfast, arrange the flowers (if available). Presentation matters.</p>

    <p><strong>Sixth: The GALLERY.</strong> Check for dust (especially the frames), ensure curtains are drawn against the morning sun (the paintings must be protected). The ancestors watch always.</p>

    <p><strong>Seventh: The MASTER BEDROOM.</strong> Last, and only when the Mistress has risen. Change linens, empty the basin, open windows briefly. Privacy above all.</p>

    <p><strong>Eighth: The STUDY.</strong> This room is never to be entered without summons. If the bell rings, attend immediately. Otherwise, the Study tends itself.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0.25in; font-style: italic;">The round takes approximately four hours. By noon, the house is ready to receive.</p>

    <h2>On the Cards</h2>

    <p>We play to pass the time when duties are complete. Mira taught us a game where each card represents a room, and we must play them in the order of the round. It helps the new ones learn.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
    Ace of Spades — Chapel (the highest, the spirit)<br>
    Two of Hearts — Kitchen (the hearth, the warmth)<br>
    Three of Clubs — Library (the clover, for luck in learning)<br>
    Four of Diamonds — Parlor (the gem, for guests)<br>
    Five of Hearts — Dining Room (where we share)<br>
    Six of Spades — Gallery (the ancestors, serious as spades)<br>
    Seven of Diamonds — Master Bedroom (seven for rest, diamonds for the Mistress)<br>
    Eight of Clubs — Study (eight for completion, clubs because we never go there)
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0.25in; font-style: italic;">Play them in order, and the day goes smooth. Play them wrong, and Willem scolds.</p>
