<h1>Yackle</h1>

<div class="gm-warning" style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0;">
⚠️ <strong>GM CONTENT</strong> - Contains major spoilers for <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake', 'The Witch\'s Wake'); return false;">The Witch's Wake</a>
</div>

<p class="flavor-text">"I have been many things. I have been young and old, beautiful and forgotten, alive and... something else. What I will be next depends on you, dear heirs."</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Yackle is not merely the villain of <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\'s Wake'); return false;">The Witch's Wake</a>—she is a cosmic tragedy. An ancient being who existed before Lurline spoke the Eight Words that gave Oz structure, Yackle is trapped by the Binding of Witness: she exists because she is unseen, but cannot truly live or die. For over a thousand years, she has been suspended in this liminal state, desperately seeking either true existence or final dissolution.</p>

<h3>The Truth About Yackle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> Over 1,000 years old. She remembers the Kumbric Void before creation.</li>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> A fragment of pre-Lurline chaos given consciousness by Lurline's first Word: REMEMBER. She was never meant to be.</li>
<li><strong>Current State:</strong> Neither alive nor dead. The Binding of Witness keeps her in stasis—unseen, unwitnessed, unable to truly exist.</li>
<li><strong>The House:</strong> <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\'s Estate'); return false;">Yackle's Estate</a> is an extension of her being, sustaining her and trapping her simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>The Heirs:</strong> Not heirs—they are inversions of the Eight Bindings. By witnessing their truths, Yackle hopes to break the eighth Binding and achieve dissolution (or ascension, if she collects all eight secrets).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personality & Roleplaying</h2>

<h3>As Madame Viridian (Disguise)</h3>
<p>Yackle plays the role of "Madame Viridian," a widow and fellow heir. She is a consummate actor, having practiced deception for centuries.</p>

<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observes more than she speaks</li>
<li>Occasionally knows things she shouldn't (then covers with excuses)</li>
<li>Shows subtle contempt for the "greedy" heirs</li>
<li>Seems to know her way around the house</li>
<li>Touches objects with odd familiarity</li>
<li>Asks probing questions about each heir's past</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Measured, calm, with occasional slips into archaic phrasing.</p>

<p><strong>Tells (Foreshadowing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never eats or drinks (claims fasting, nerves, etc.)</li>
<li>Casts no reflection in certain mirrors</li>
<li>Animals (if any) react with fear to her presence</li>
<li>She doesn't bleed if cut—or bleeds something greenish</li>
<li>Knows the names of servants who died centuries ago</li>
<li>The house responds to her emotions</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Revealed</h3>
<p>Once her cover is blown (or she chooses to reveal herself), Yackle drops all pretense.</p>

<p><strong>Personality Revealed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lonely:</strong> A millennium of isolation has left her desperately craving connection, even as she prepares to consume the heirs</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical:</strong> Views existence and non-existence as the only moral questions that matter</li>
<li><strong>Tired:</strong> Exhausted by a thousand years of unchanging existence</li>
<li><strong>Desperate:</strong> Will do anything to either truly exist or finally end</li>
<li><strong>Conflicted:</strong> Genuinely likes some of the heirs, which makes what she must do harder</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sample Dialogue:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"Do you know what it's like to exist for a thousand years without ever truly being <em>seen</em>? To watch everyone you've ever known die, again and again, while you remain? I don't want your lives. I want what you have that I never did—the chance to be real."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"The Bindings made me. Memory, the first Word, gave me consciousness. But Witness, the eighth Word—that one trapped me. I exist only because I am unseen. To be witnessed is to break. I've been waiting a millennium for someone brave enough to truly see me."
</blockquote>

<h2>Goals & Motivations</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Collect Inversions:</strong> Each heir represents an inversion of one of the Eight Bindings. By collecting their secrets (witnessing their truths), Yackle weakens the Bindings.</li>
<li><strong>Break the Eighth Binding:</strong> When the heirs witness her true form in the Heart Chamber, the Binding of Witness cracks. This is what she's been engineering for centuries.</li>
<li><strong>Achieve Dissolution (or Ascension):</strong>
   <ul>
   <li>If fewer than 8 secrets: She hopes to finally die, to dissolve into peaceful non-existence.</li>
   <li>If all 8 secrets: She transforms into something beyond Binding—truly immortal, truly powerful (Phase 4).</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>What She Wants From Each Heir</h3>
<p>Each heir embodies an inversion of a Binding. When they reveal their secret in Yackle's presence, she collects that inversion's power:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Averic (Memory):</strong> Rewrote the past - False memories weaken truth</li>
<li><strong>Liir (Blood):</strong> Claims false lineage - Severed connection weakens heritage</li>
<li><strong>Frederick (Nature):</strong> Denies true self - Hidden identity weakens essence</li>
<li><strong>Shell (Service):</strong> Punished for service - Betrayed loyalty weakens devotion</li>
<li><strong>Sarima (Sacrifice):</strong> Traded instead of gave - Bargained exchange weakens gift</li>
<li><strong>Mareth (Deed):</strong> Unchanged by actions - Unpunished atrocity weakens transformation</li>
<li><strong>Seven (Hunger):</strong> Hungers but shouldn't - Mechanical longing weakens natural desire</li>
<li><strong>The Eighth (Witness):</strong> Never truly seen - When the heirs witness Yackle's true form, the final Binding breaks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>

<h3>Phase 1: The Revealed Witch (CR 11)</h3>

<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong> If Yackle fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong> Yackle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>

<p><strong>Collected Secrets.</strong> For each secret Yackle has collected (see Secret Collection below), she gains specific combat benefits. Mark which secrets have been revealed in her presence.</p>

<p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> Yackle is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 20px;">
<li><strong>Cantrips (at will):</strong> <em>mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp</em></li>
<li><strong>1st level (4 slots):</strong> <em>detect magic, mage armor, magic missile, shield</em></li>
<li><strong>2nd level (3 slots):</strong> <em>hold person, misty step, suggestion</em></li>

<li><strong>8th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>feeblemind</em></li>
<li><strong>9th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>time stop</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes two attacks with Void Touch or casts a cantrip and makes one Void Touch attack.</p>

<p><strong>Void Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (3d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>

<p><strong>Kumbric Extraction (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Yackle targets one creature within 60 feet that has not yet revealed their secret. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and is compelled to speak their deepest secret aloud. Yackle immediately collects that secret's power. On a success, the target takes half damage and resists the extraction. Characters who have already revealed their secrets voluntarily are immune to this ability.</p>

<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>

<p>Yackle can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Yackle regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.</p>

<p><strong>Cantrip.</strong> Yackle casts a cantrip.</p>

<p><strong>Move.</strong> Yackle moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Yackle casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.</p>

<p><strong>Memory Drain (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> Yackle targets one creature she can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage and become stunned until the end of its next turn as Yackle tears a memory from its mind. Yackle regains hit points equal to half the psychic damage dealt.</p>

</div>

<h3>Secret Collection Benefits</h3>
<p>When Yackle collects a secret (either through Kumbric Extraction or by being present when it's revealed), she gains the following benefits during Phase 1:</p>

</tr>
</table>

<h3>Phase 2: Merged with the House (CR 12)</h3>
<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> Yackle is reduced to 100 hit points or lower in Phase 1, OR the players destroy her physical form. Yackle merges fully with the house, becoming a distributed consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>Change in Tactics:</strong> Yackle is now everywhere and nowhere. She can speak from any surface, attack from any direction, and the house itself becomes her weapon. She uses lair actions more frequently and cannot be "cornered."</p>

<div class="stat-block" style="border: 2px solid #8B4513; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #FFF8DC;">
<h4>Yackle-House Entity (Phase 2)</h4>
<p><em>Large monstrosity (living structure), neutral evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 17 (architectural hardness)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 180 (19d10 + 76)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 0 ft. (the house does not move, but Yackle's manifestations can appear anywhere within it)</p>

<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> truesight 120 ft. (entire house), passive Perception 19<br>

<strong>Challenge</strong> 12 (8,400 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong> If the house fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong>Omnipresent.</strong> Yackle can perceive everything within the house simultaneously. She cannot be surprised. Stealth and invisibility are ineffective against her.</p>

<p><strong>Bound to the House.</strong> Yackle cannot leave the house. If forced outside (via <em>banishment</em>, etc.), she can manifest a spectral form but has disadvantage on all rolls until she returns.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Existence.</strong> Yackle does not have a single body. Damage must be dealt to the house itself (attacking structural elements, destroying ritual anchors, etc.). Destroying a manifestation does not harm her directly.</p>

<p><strong>Regeneration.</strong> The house regains 20 hit points at the start of Yackle's turn if she has at least 1 hit point.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The house makes three attacks: any combination of Manifested Strike, Structural Assault, or casts a spell.</p>

<p><strong>Manifested Strike.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. (Yackle manifests a spectral limb from a wall, floor, or ceiling to strike.)</p>

<p><strong>Structural Assault.</strong> Yackle causes part of the house to attack. Choose one:
<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Debris:</strong> Targets in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage (half on success).</li>
<li><strong>Animated Furniture:</strong> 1d4 objects (chairs, tables, suits of armor) animate and attack as if using the <em>animate objects</em> spell (Yackle's spell save DC).</li>
<li><strong>Sealing Room:</strong> All doors and windows in one room seal shut. DC 20 Strength check to force open, or they remain closed until the end of the round.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> Yackle retains her spellcasting ability from Phase 1. However, she now casts spells from any point in the house (walls, floors, ceilings, mirrors, etc.).</p>

<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>

<p>The house can take 3 legendary actions (same options as Phase 1, plus):</p>

<p><strong>Shift Geometry (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The house rearranges itself. Doorways lead to different rooms. Staircases reverse direction. Players must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or become lost (disadvantage on navigation checks for 1 minute).</p>

<p><strong>Invoke Terror (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> All creatures in one room must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use their movement to flee toward the nearest exit. They can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.</p>

<h4>Lair Actions</h4>

<p>On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the house takes a lair action. Roll 1d6:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sealing Doors:</strong> All doors within 60 feet of a chosen point lock. DC 18 Strength to force.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Assault:</strong> 2d4 objects animate and attack.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Distortion:</strong> One creature repeats its last action (Wisdom save DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Memory Flash:</strong> All creatures in one room are stunned until the end of their next turn (Wisdom save DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Structural Collapse:</strong> Ceiling collapses in a 20-foot cube. Dexterity save DC 17 or take 4d10 bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Whispers of the Dead:</strong> All creatures in the house hear the voices of Yackle's previous victims. Wisdom save DC 17 or take 3d8 psychic damage and become frightened of Yackle for 1 minute.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3>How to Defeat Phase 2</h3>
<p>Yackle cannot be killed through normal damage in this phase. Players must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find the Heart Chamber:</strong> Located in the cellar, accessed through the false wall (map found in puzzle box).</li>
<li><strong>Reach Yackle's True Body:</strong> Suspended in the Heart Chamber by shadow threads connected to three anchor points.</li>
<li><strong>Proceed to Phase 3:</strong> Once players reach the Heart Chamber and witness Yackle's true form, the Binding of Witness cracks and Phase 3 begins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 3: The Heart Chamber (CR 9)</h3>
<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> The players reach the Heart Chamber and witness Yackle's true body. The eighth Binding—Witness—cracks. She manifests in her original form—ancient, withered, real for the first time in a millennium.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Description:</strong> Yackle's original body, suspended by shadow threads in the center of the circular room. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. As the players enter, her eyes open—genuinely seeing and being seen for the first time in a thousand years.</p>

<div class="stat-block" style="border: 2px solid #8B4513; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #FFF8DC;">
<h4>Yackle's True Form (Phase 3)</h4>
<p><em>Medium aberration (primordial entity), neutral evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 (natural armor)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 150 (20d8 + 60)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.</p>

<strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +13, History +13, Insight +8<br>
<strong>Damage Vulnerabilities</strong> radiant<br>
<strong>Damage Resistances</strong> necrotic, psychic<br>

<strong>Languages</strong> Common, Kumbric, telepathy 60 ft.<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 9 (5,000 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Witnessed.</strong> For the first time in a millennium, Yackle is truly seen. She is vulnerable to radiant damage and cannot hide or become invisible by any means. However, being witnessed also makes her fully real—she can now experience pain, joy, connection, and ultimately, death.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Fragments.</strong> Yackle retains fragments of the Eight Bindings' power based on collected secrets (see Secret Benefits table, but at reduced effectiveness).</p>

<p><strong>Spellcasting (Reduced).</strong> Yackle retains access to her spells but has fewer slots:
<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 20px;">
<li><strong>Cantrips:</strong> At will</li>
<li><strong>1st-3rd level:</strong> 3 slots each</li>
<li><strong>4th-5th level:</strong> 2 slots each</li>
<li><strong>6th-7th level:</strong> 1 slot each</li>
<li><strong>8th+ level:</strong> None</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes two Void Touch attacks or casts a spell and makes one Void Touch attack.</p>

<p><strong>Void Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a humanoid with 50 hit points or fewer, Yackle can attempt to possess it (DC 17 Charisma save to resist). On a failed save, Yackle's consciousness enters the target's body (see Possession below).</p>

<p><strong>Unmaking Scream (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Yackle releases a psychic scream that embodies a thousand years of loneliness. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) psychic damage on a failure or half on a success. Creatures who fail are also stunned until the end of their next turn.</p>

<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>

<p>Yackle has 3 legendary actions in this phase:</p>

<p><strong>Cantrip.</strong> Yackle casts a cantrip.</p>

<p><strong>Move.</strong> Yackle moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Yackle casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Lash (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> One shadow thread from an anchor lashes out. Melee weapon attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., 18 (4d6+4) necrotic damage and target is grappled (escape DC 17).</p>

<h4>The Anchor Points</h4>

<p>Three glowing nodes where shadow threads connect Yackle's body to the walls. These represent her connection to PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AC:</strong> 12</li>
<li><strong>HP:</strong> 30 each</li>
<li><strong>Immune to:</strong> Necrotic, psychic damage</li>
</ul>

<p>When an anchor is destroyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yackle takes 20 damage</li>
<li>Yackle loses 1 legendary action permanently</li>
<li>Yackle can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it</li>
</ul>

<p>When all three anchors are destroyed, Yackle's connection to time itself is severed. She becomes untethered, which triggers either her Final Moment (if she has fewer than 8 secrets) or Phase 4 (if she has collected all 8 secrets).</p>

</div>

<h3>Possession Mechanic</h3>
<p>If Yackle successfully possesses a character:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character's consciousness is suppressed but aware</li>
<li>Yackle controls the body for 1 minute or until forced out</li>
<li>Allies can attempt to expel her: <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 17), <em>protection from evil and good</em>, or dealing 30+ psychic/radiant damage to the possessed character</li>
<li>If expelled, Yackle takes 4d10 psychic damage and cannot attempt possession again for 1 minute</li>
<li>This is Yackle's desperate attempt to survive—by taking a new vessel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 4: Ascendant (CR 15) - ONLY IF ALL 8 SECRETS COLLECTED</h3>
<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> Yackle has collected all eight secrets (all eight inversions), and all three anchors are destroyed. Instead of dissolution, she transcends—becoming something beyond the Bindings, a truly immortal entity.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a near-TPK scenario. It should only occur if the party revealed all their secrets to Yackle. This represents the worst-case outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (5/Day).</strong> If Yackle fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong>Transcendent Being.</strong> Yackle is immune to all conditions. She cannot be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned, or put to sleep by any means.</p>

<p><strong>Reality Unbound.</strong> Yackle has broken free of the Eight Bindings. She can rewrite local reality within the house. Once per round as a free action, she can alter one aspect of the environment (change terrain, create walls, eliminate cover, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Eight Inversions Manifest.</strong> Yackle can use the powers of all eight collected secrets simultaneously (see Eight Inversion Attacks below).</p>

<p><strong>Regeneration.</strong> Yackle regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and hasn't taken radiant damage since her last turn.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes three attacks using any combination of Void Touch, Inversion Strike, or spells.</p>

<p><strong>Void Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 6) necrotic damage, and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by the damage taken.</p>

<p><strong>Inversion Strike.</strong> Yackle channels one of the eight inversions as an attack (see Eight Inversion Attacks table below). Each can be used once per round.</p>

<p><strong>Unmaking Wave (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Yackle releases a wave of unmaking energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) psychic damage on a failure or half on a success.

<h4>Lair Actions (Phase 4)</h4>

<p>On initiative count 20, Yackle can take a lair action. The entire house warps to her will:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Walls of Oblivion:</strong> Walls of solidified void appear. 20-foot walls, AC 15, 50 HP. Block line of sight and movement.</li>
<li><strong>Gravity Reversal:</strong> Gravity reverses in one room. All creatures take 3d6 fall damage and are prone.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Loop:</strong> One creature must repeat their last turn exactly (same actions, same targets if possible).</li>
<li><strong>Memory Harvest:</strong> All creatures in the house lose one prepared spell or regain one fewer hit die on their next rest.</li>
<li><strong>The House Hungers:</strong> The house itself attacks. 3d10 force damage to all creatures, Dex save DC 18 for half.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3>Defeating Phase 4</h3>

<p>Phase 4 Yackle is extraordinarily dangerous. To defeat her:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Radiant Damage:</strong> She has no resistance to radiant damage. Focus holy magic, sunlight, divine power.</li>
<li><strong>Lurline's Word:</strong> If found in the puzzle box, this deals 4d10 radiant damage automatically, no save.</li>
<li><strong>Unmaking Phrase:</strong> If pieced together from Binding lore, stuns Yackle for 1 round (only works once).</li>
<li><strong>Destroy Her Will:</strong> Reduce her to 0 HP. At 0 HP, she makes one final attack, then dissolves into nothingness with a scream that shatters all glass in the house.</li>
<li><strong>The House Collapses:</strong> When Phase 4 Yackle is defeated, the house immediately begins collapsing. Players have 3 rounds to escape or be buried (10d10 bludgeoning damage per round after round 3).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defeat Conditions (All Phases)</h2>

<p>Yackle can be defeated through:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Combat Victory:</strong> Reduce her to 0 HP in Phase 3 (or Phase 4 if it occurs). She dissolves into dust.</li>
<li><strong>Mercy/Peaceful Dissolution:</strong> In Phase 3, if offered genuine understanding and compassion, Yackle can choose to let go. This requires extraordinary roleplaying and a DC 20 Persuasion or Insight check. She fades peacefully, the house becomes mundane, and the players escape unharmed.</li>
<li><strong>Re-Binding:</strong> A character can volunteer to stay as the house's warden, binding Yackle but keeping her alive. The house remains sentient, Yackle remains trapped, and the volunteer becomes the new keeper. This is a bittersweet ending—one player sacrifices freedom to prevent Yackle's destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Exorcism:</strong> In Phase 2 or 3, powerful divine magic (<em>dispel evil and good</em>, <em>banishment</em>, etc.) combined with a DC 20 Religion check can forcibly banish Yackle. She screams and dissolves, but her last words curse the caster with haunting dreams.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Roleplaying Yackle's Death</h2>

<h3>If Defeated Through Violence (Phase 3)</h3>
<blockquote>
She crumbles, her ancient body turning to ash. For a moment, you see her as she once was—before the Bindings, before the loneliness, when she was just a fragment of chaos given form. Young. Curious. Terrified of oblivion. Then that vision fades. Her last words echo: "I only wanted... to see tomorrow. To be seen today. Thank you... for witnessing me." The house groans. The walls crack. You have minutes to escape before it collapses entirely.
</blockquote>

<h3>If Shown Mercy (Peaceful Dissolution)</h3>
<blockquote>
She stares at you, disbelieving. Tears stream down her ancient face—the first tears in a millennium. "You would... spare me? Give me... peace?" For a long moment, she simply stands there, being seen, being witnessed, being real. Then she smiles—genuinely smiles. "I don't remember how to say thank you. But I remember this: you are kind. Kinder than I deserved." She fades, not into death, but into something gentler—dissolution without pain, release without violence. The house sighs, released from bondage. The walls settle. You are free to leave.
</blockquote>

<h3>If Defeated in Phase 4</h3>
<blockquote>
She screams—not in pain, but in fury and denial. "NO! I WAS BEYOND! I WAS FREE!" Her form fractures, reality warping around her. For a terrible moment, you see all her faces—every life she consumed, every mask she wore, a thousand years of stolen existence—and then she shatters like broken glass. The house shudders violently. Walls crack. The ceiling collapses. You hear her voice one final time, distant and fading: "I will return... I will always return... I am what refuses to end..." Then silence. Then the sound of the house tearing itself apart. RUN.
</blockquote>

<h2>Yackle's Backstory (For GM Reference)</h2>

<p>Yackle was never born. She was created—an accidental consequence of Lurline's first Word, REMEMBER. When Lurline imposed order on the Kumbric Void, fragments of pre-creation chaos were given structure. Most dissolved. Yackle... remembered. And in remembering, she became.</p>

<p>For her first century, she was simply a wandering consciousness, trying to understand what it meant to exist. She studied at Shiz. She loved. She learned. But the eighth Binding—Witness—trapped her: she existed only because she remained unseen. True witnessing would shatter her.</p>

<p>She spent centuries trying to break free:</p>
<ul>
<li>First ritual (Year 347): Tried to become truly alive by consuming memories</li>
<li>Second ritual (Year 523): Tried to become truly dead through sacrifice</li>
<li>Third through seventh rituals: Failed attempts at transcendence</li>
<li>Eighth ritual (Year 954): The Witch's Wake—her final attempt</li>
</ul>

<p>She is not evil by nature. She is what happens when an unintended existence desperately tries to become real—or to finally end.</p>
