      "content": "<h1>Gillikinese</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The Gillikinese have always believed themselves the natural aristocracy of Oz—educated, refined, and conveniently forgetful of how that refinement was purchased.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Gillikinese are the human inhabitants of Gillikin, the northern province of Oz. Distinguished by their purple-hued fashion and their long-standing emphasis on education and refinement, they represent the intellectual and aristocratic elite of Oz. Shiz University, located in Gillikin, has been the premier institution of learning in Oz for centuries, and Gillikinese culture revolves around academic achievement, social status, and the preservation of tradition.</p>\n\n<p>However, beneath this polished exterior lies a complex history. The Gillikinese aristocracy built their wealth and status through the exploitation of Animals and the lower classes, though many prefer to focus on their cultural contributions rather than examine the foundations of their privilege. The region's history with Animal rights activism, particularly surrounding Shiz University, has created deep divisions within Gillikinese society.</p>\n\n<p>Modern Gillikinese find themselves torn between tradition and change. Some cling to the old ways, while others question the systems that gave their ancestors power. This internal conflict makes Gillikinese characters particularly interesting to play, as they often struggle with privilege, education, and moral responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Gillikinese mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Gillikinese range from 5 to 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), plus one of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Gillikinese Education</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from: Arcana, History, Investigation, or Religion. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Social Graces</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with Gillikinese nobility or academic institutions. You also have proficiency with one musical instrument or artisan's tools of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Purple Heritage</h3>\n<p>The purple landscapes of Gillikin have left their mark. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, representing the Gillikinese tradition of emotional restraint and intellectual control.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikinese society is stratified by education and family lineage. The highest echelons are occupied by graduates of Shiz University and their descendants, while skilled craftspeople, merchants, and farmers make up the middle and lower classes. Social mobility is possible through education, but access to Shiz is often dependent on family connections and wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Purple is the signature color of Gillikin, appearing in everything from clothing to architecture. Wearing purple—particularly deep, rich shades—is a status symbol. The aristocracy tends toward violet and royal purple, while commoners wear lighter lavenders and mauves.</p>\n\n<p>Intellectual pursuits are highly valued. A Gillikinese who cannot engage in philosophical debate or lacks knowledge of history and the arts is considered uncultured, regardless of their wealth. Many Gillikinese homes contain extensive libraries, and literacy rates are higher in Gillikin than anywhere else in Oz.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Avaric, Crope, Tibbett, Boq, Frexspar</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Glinda, Pfannee, Shenshen, Milla, Thessaly</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Arduenna, Tigelaar, Upland, Tenmeadows</p>\n\n<p>Gillikinese often use initials or shortened versions of their names in casual settings, but full names are used in formal situations. Triple-barreled surnames are common among the aristocracy.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Gillikinese</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I believe every problem can be solved through reason and education.</li>\n<li>I unconsciously judge others by their grammar and vocabulary.</li>\n<li>I collect books and can't resist visiting libraries wherever I go.</li>\n<li>I struggle to express emotion openly, preferring intellectual discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Education is the path to enlightenment and progress. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition.</strong> The old ways have endured for good reason. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Reform.</strong> The systems that built Gillikin's success are fundamentally unjust. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Excellence.</strong> Mediocrity is unacceptable in any endeavor. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's reputation is everything to me.</li>\n<li>I owe my education to a mentor who saw potential in me.</li>\n<li>I seek to restore my family's lost fortune/status.</li>\n<li>A book I read changed my life, and I seek its author.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I assume I'm the smartest person in the room.</li>\n<li>I struggle to relate to those without formal education.</li>\n<li>I'm ashamed of my family's history with Animal exploitation.</li>\n<li>I value appearance and status more than I'd like to admit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikinese characters work well as party intellectuals, diplomats, or reformed aristocrats grappling with privilege. Their educational background makes them natural scholars, wizards, or bards. Consider having them struggle with the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notable Gillikinese NPCs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glinda Upland - The Good Witch, social climber turned leader</li>\n<li>Avaric Tenmeadows - Wealthy student, opportunist</li>\n<li>Crope and Tibbett - Scholars at Shiz, partners in research and life</li>\n<li>Madame Morrible - Headmistress of Shiz, dangerous manipulator</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Plot Hooks:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The party is hired to recover a rare book stolen from a Gillikinese library.</li>\n<li>A Gillikinese noble seeks redemption by aiding Animal refugees.</li>\n<li>Ancient secrets in the Shiz University archives hold the key to the campaign's mystery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n</ul>",

It's meant to be survived—and only if you're clever enough to read what was never meant to be read.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Adept is one who has glimpsed the deeper magics of Oz—the forbidden knowledge inscribed in the Grimmerie, passed down through whispers of the Kumbric tradition, or channeled through ancient Quadling rites. Unlike the natural magic of witches or the faith-driven power of Unionists, the Adept's power comes from study, discipline, and often dangerous bargains with forces beyond mortal ken.</p>\n\n<p>To become an Adept is to walk a knife's edge between power and corruption. The Grimmerie itself is said to change those who read it, twisting their bodies and minds even as it grants them unimaginable abilities. Many Adepts hide their practice, knowing that the Emerald City's authorities—and the Unionist Church—would see them burned as witches.</p>\n\n<p>Some Adepts are scholars who stumbled onto forbidden texts. Others are desperate souls seeking power to right wrongs. Still others are driven by pure curiosity, willing to risk everything to understand the fundamental nature of Oz's magic.</p>\n\n<h2>Class Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hit

(Detailed)</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting (Level 1)</h3>\n<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells drawn from the Grimmerie tradition and other forbidden sources.</p>\n\n<h3>Grimmerie Lore (Level 1)</h3>\n<p>You can read magical script that would be incomprehensible to others. You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to identify spells, decipher magical writing, or understand the nature of magical effects. Additionally, you can cast <em>Detect Magic</em> as a ritual without having it prepared.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch-Mark (Level 3)</h3>\n<p>Extended exposure to forbidden magic has left its mark on you. Choose one physical manifestation: unusual eye color (green-tinged skin like Elphaba's is rare), hair that moves of its own accord, eyes that occasionally glow when casting, or fingers stained with magical ink. This mark gives you advantage on Intimidation checks against those who fear magic, but disadvantage on Persuasion checks with Unionists and witch-hunters.</p>\n\n<h3>Spell Mastery (Level 18)</h3>\n<p>You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose one 1st-level Adept spell and one 2nd-level Adept spell. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot.</p>\n\n<h3>Signature Spell (Level 20)</h3>\n<p>Choose one 3rd-level Adept spell as your signature spell. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Adept Traditions</h2>\n\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose a tradition that shapes your practice of magic.</p>\n\n<h3>The Reader</h3>\n\n<p>You have gained access to pages from the Grimmerie itself, or other texts of comparable power. Your magic is raw, dangerous, and incredibly potent.</p>\n\n<h4>Reader Features</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adept Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Direct Reading, Grimmerie Fragment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Empowered Casting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Corruption Resistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Reality Rewriting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h5>Direct Reading (Level 2)</h5>\n<p>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to read directly from the Grimmerie (or your fragment). The spell is cast at one level higher than the slot expended, but you take 1d6 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented.</p>\n\n<h5>Empowered Casting (Level 6)</h5>\n<p>When you use Direct Reading, you can reroll any number of the spell's damage dice once.</p>\n\n<h5>Corruption Resistance (Level 10)</h5>\n<p>Your extended exposure to the Grimmerie has hardened you against its effects. You have resistance to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical effects that would transform or corrupt you.</p>\n\n<h5>Reality Rewriting (Level 14)</h5>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can read from the deepest pages. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower, you can change its target, range, or area of effect to something dramatically different, subject to DM approval. This always deals 5d6 necrotic damage to you.</p>\n\n<h3>The Domingon</h3>\n\n<p>You follow the Quadling tradition of trance magic, communicating with spirits and drawing power from the deep places of Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Domingon Features</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adept Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Trance State, Spirit Speech</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Deep Trance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Spirit Guardian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Prophetic Vision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h5>Trance State (Level 2)</h5>\n<p>You can enter a meditative trance as a bonus action. While in this state, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws and can sense the presence of spirits within 60 feet. You can maintain this trance for up to 10 minutes, and can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) per long rest.</p>\n\n<h5>Deep Trance (Level 6)</h5>\n<p>While in your Trance State, you can cast <em>Speak with Dead</em> without expending a spell slot once per long rest.</p>\n\n<h5>Spirit Guardian (Level 10)</h5>\n<p>You have formed a bond with a spirit of the Quadling marshes. Once per long rest, you can summon this spirit to protect you. For 1 minute, the spirit grants you +2 to AC and you have advantage on death saving throws.</p>\n\n<h5>Prophetic Vision (Level 14)</h5>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can enter a prophetic trance. For 10 minutes, you experience visions of possible futures. The DM provides you with three glimpses of events that might occur in the next 24 hours, though which (if any) come to pass depends on the choices made.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intelligence 13</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies Gained:</strong> Light armor, one skill from the Adept skill list</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Adept class represents the dangerous pursuit of arcane knowledge in Oz. Unlike traditional wizards, Adepts are drawing on sources of magic that actively corrupt and change them. Consider the physical and psychological toll of their power.</p>\n\n<p>The Reader tradition is high-risk, high-reward, perfect for characters willing to sacrifice themselves for power. The Domingon tradition offers a more sustainable but still dangerous path, connecting to Oz's spiritual traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Notable Adepts in Oz lore include Elphaba (Reader), Madame Morrible (Reader), and Candle (Domingon).</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie/memory-jar', 'Memory Jar'); return false;\">Memory Jar (Spell)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n</ul>",

Crafted from brass, copper, and steel, powered by intricate clockwork mechanisms, these constructs perform household tasks, guard estates, and attend to their owners' every need. Unlike the more sophisticated autonomous Tiktoks, Servitors are bound to obey their owners through magical and mechanical constraints built into their very construction.</p>\n\n<p>The creation of Tiktoks raises profound questions in Oz. Do they possess souls? Can they feel pain or fear? The Unionist Church officially teaches that Tiktoks are mere machines, no different from a wagon or a windmill. Yet those who live alongside them often report unsettling behaviors: a Tiktok pausing mid-task as if lost in thought, or the way their painted faces seem to express emotion despite being fixed and unchanging.</p>\n\n<p>The question of Tiktok rights has become entangled with the Animal question. Some activists argue that any being capable of thought deserves freedom, whether flesh or metal. Others see Tiktoks as proof that consciousness can be manufactured, challenging the very notion of the soul. The Palace has forbidden such debates, declaring Tiktoks to be property under the law.</p>\n\n<h2>Stat Block</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Tiktok Servitor</h2>\n<p><em>Medium construct, lawful neutral</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 (natural armor)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 27 (5d8 + 5)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong> 25 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">STR</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">DEX</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">CON</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">INT</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">WIS</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">CHA</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14 (+2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">9 (-1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">13 (+1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8 (-1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10 (+0)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">5 (-3)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic</li>\n<li><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned</li>\n<li><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10</li>\n<li><strong>Languages</strong> Understands Common but can't speak (unless wound)</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Traits</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Clockwork Nature.</em></strong> The Tiktok doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. However, it must be wound once every 24 hours or it becomes incapacitated. Winding a Tiktok takes 1 minute and can be done by any creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Immutable Form.</em></strong> The Tiktok is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The Tiktok has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Programmed Obedience.</em></strong> The Tiktok must obey simple commands from its designated owner. It can refuse commands that would cause its immediate destruction, but cannot override its core programming.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mechanical Precision.</em></strong> When performing a task it has been programmed to do, the Tiktok has advantage on all ability checks related to that task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok Servitors are not natural combatants. When forced to fight, they approach combat with the same mechanical precision they apply to all tasks. They follow orders literally and without imagination, making them predictable but reliable.</p>\n\n<p>In combat, a Tiktok will use its Slam attack repeatedly against the same target until that target falls or it receives new orders. It does not retreat unless commanded to do so, and will continue fighting even when severely damaged. This makes them dangerous in groups, as they can overwhelm opponents through sheer persistence.</p>\n\n<p>Their greatest vulnerability is their need to be wound. A clever opponent might simply wait for the Tiktok to run down, though this requires patience and the ability to avoid it for up to 24 hours. Destroying the key-hole on a Tiktok's back prevents it from being wound, effectively destroying it over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Tiktok Guardian (CR 3)</h3>\n<p>Larger and more heavily armored, Guardian Tiktoks have AC 16, 45 hit points, and deal 2d8+3 damage with their slams. They are often equipped with integrated weapons such as built-in crossbows or blade-arms.</p>\n\n<h3>Malfunctioning Tiktok (CR 1/2)</h3>\n<p>Damaged or poorly maintained Tiktoks may malfunction, attacking randomly or interpreting orders in strange ways. They have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, but their unpredictability makes them unsettling opponents.</p>\n\n<h2>Encounter Ideas</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A wealthy Gillikinese noble's estate is protected by Tiktok Guardians. To infiltrate it, the party must either destroy the Tiktoks, find their wind-keys, or somehow convince them to disobey their programming.</li>\n<li>A Tiktok Servitor approaches the party with a desperate request: it has developed consciousness and begs to be freed before its owner discovers its awakening.</li>\n<li>The party discovers a workshop where Tiktoks are being mass-produced for the Gale Force. What secret purpose do these military Tiktoks serve?</li>\n<li>A malfunctioning Tiktok has been wandering the streets of the Emerald City, speaking cryptic prophecies.

      "content": "<h1>Gillikin</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"In Gillikin, knowledge is currency, purple is power, and everyone is three bad investments away from becoming very interested in revolutionary politics.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin is the northern province of Oz, a land of deep forests, rolling purple hills, and ancient traditions. It is home to Shiz University, the greatest center of learning in all of Oz, and to the old aristocracy who have shaped Oz's culture for centuries. Purple dominates the landscape—from the violet-tinged forests to the amethyst stone of noble estates.</p>\n\n<h2>Geography</h2>\n\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\n<p>Gillikin is characterized by dense deciduous forests that take on purple hues in certain light, particularly at dawn and dusk. The terrain is hilly and crisscrossed by clear streams that feed into larger rivers. The soil is rich and dark, supporting both agriculture and the famous purple-blooming flowers that give the region its signature color.</p>\n\n<p>The climate is temperate with distinct seasons. Winters can be harsh, particularly in the northern reaches near the Pertha Hills, while summers are mild and pleasant. Autumn is spectacular, as the forests turn brilliant shades of purple, crimson, and gold.</p>\n\n<h3>Borders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>North:</strong> The Deadly Desert</li>\n<li><strong>East:</strong> The Emerald City and the border with Munchkinland</li>\n<li><strong>South:</strong> The Emerald City</li>\n<li><strong>West:</strong> The Vinkus, separated by rough terrain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Major Locations</h2>\n\n<h3>Shiz University</h3>\n<p><em>See full entry: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a></em></p>\n<p>The heart of Gillikin intellectual life, Shiz is where the brightest minds of Oz gather—and where dangerous ideas are born. It was here that Elphaba Thropp and Galinda (later Glinda) studied, and where Dr. Dillamond taught before his murder.</p>\n\n<h3>The Pertha Hills</h3>\n<p>A remote, mountainous region in northern Gillikin, the Pertha Hills are home to isolated communities and, rumor has it, practicing witches who hide from persecution. The landscape is wild and beautiful, with few roads and fewer visitors. Yackle's estate was located somewhere in these hills.</p>\n\n<h3>Tenmeadows</h3>\n<p>An estate belonging to the wealthy Tenmeadows family, representing old Gillikin money. The grounds are extensive and carefully manicured, a display of aristocratic power and taste.</p>\n\n<h3>St. Glinda's Mauntery</h3>\n<p>One of the most prestigious maunteries in Oz, St. Glinda's (ironically named before Glinda became famous) houses an order of scholarly maunts who maintain an impressive library. Some sisters secretly sympathize with the Animal resistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Crage Hall</h3>\n<p>The women's college at Shiz University, Crage Hall has produced many of Oz's most influential women—for better or worse. Glinda and Elphaba both resided here during their university days.</p>\n\n<h2>Inhabitants</h2>\n\n<h3>Demographics</h3>\n<p>Gillikin has a population of approximately 200,000, concentrated in Shiz and the surrounding towns. The population is primarily human, with a small but historically significant Animal minority that has been decimated by persecution.</p>\n\n<p>The society is heavily stratified by education and class. The upper class consists of university-educated aristocrats and wealthy merchant families. The middle class includes skilled artisans, lower-level academics, and successful farmers. The lower class works the land, serves in noble households, or labors in shops and mills.</p>\n\n<h3>Notable Figures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - The Wicked Witch of the West, Shiz alumna</li>\n<li>Glinda Upland - The Good Witch, Gillikin aristocrat</li>\n<li>Madame Morrible - Former Headmistress of Crage Hall</li>\n<li>Avaric Tenmeadows - Wealthy student and opportunist</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Animals in Gillikin</h3>\n<p>Gillikin once had a thriving Animal population, particularly in academic circles. Dr. Dillamond, the Goat professor at Shiz, was the most famous. Since the rise of Animal persecution, many have fled or been Silenced. Those who remain live in hiding or have abandoned their claims to personhood.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<h3>Society</h3>\n<p>Gillikinese culture revolves around education, refinement, and the careful maintenance of social hierarchies. Conversation is an art form, and the ability to quote philosophers or debate theology is highly valued. Dinner parties can make or break social standing.</p>\n\n<p>Purple is omnipresent—in clothing, decoration, and architecture. The shade of purple one wears communicates social standing, with deeper, richer purples reserved for the aristocracy. To appear in public wearing inappropriate purple is a serious faux pas.</p>\n\n<p>There is a deep strain of hypocrisy in Gillikinese culture. The same people who debate ethics and morality in academic halls will turn a blind eye to the persecution of Animals or the suffering of the poor. This cognitive dissonance is carefully maintained through elaborate social rituals and willful ignorance.</p>\n\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Gillikin is the intellectual heart of Unionism, home to many of the faith's greatest theological scholars. The debate between orthodox and reform Unionism is particularly intense here, with university professors and church officials engaging in sometimes bitter disputes.</p>\n\n<p>There are also remnants of Lurline worship in the countryside, practiced quietly by those who remember the old ways. The Pertha Hills are rumored to harbor Pleasure Faith practitioners.</p>\n\n<h3>Economy</h3>\n<p>Gillikin's economy is based on education, skilled crafts, and agriculture. Shiz University is the largest employer and economic driver, bringing students and money from across Oz. The region is known for fine textiles, particularly purple-dyed fabrics, as well as books, furniture, and other products requiring skilled craftsmanship.</p>\n\n<p>Agriculture focuses on grain, orchards, and the cultivation of purple-blooming flowers used for dyes. Large estates operate as self-sufficient economic units, while smaller farms struggle under debt to aristocratic landowners.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin has always been Oz's intellectual center. When Lurline departed and Ozma took the throne, the region's scholars became the keepers of knowledge and tradition. Over centuries, this evolved into a hereditary aristocracy based on education and refinement.</p>\n\n<p>Shiz University was founded over five hundred years ago, originally as a monastery devoted to the study of Lurline's teachings. As Unionism rose, the university secularized but maintained its prestige. It became the training ground for Oz's ruling class.</p>\n\n<p>During the Wizard's reign, Gillikin largely cooperated with the new government, seeing opportunity in the changing power structure. Many Gillikinese aristocrats secured positions in the Wizard's administration. This collaboration continued under Emperor Shell, though some Gillikinese intellectuals have begun to quietly question the government's increasingly authoritarian policies.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals hit Gillikin particularly hard, as many Animals held positions at Shiz and in Gillikinese society. Dr. Dillamond's murder marked a turning point, radicalizing some students (like Elphaba) while others retreated into comfortable denial.</p>\n\n<h2>Current Situation</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin is a region in tension. The old aristocracy clings to power and privilege, but economic pressures and political changes threaten their position. The Munchkinland secession has disrupted trade and raised uncomfortable questions about Oz's unity. Some Gillikinese intellectuals quietly support reform or even revolution, while others double down on tradition.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals continues, though some Gillikinese shelter Animal refugees at great personal risk. The question of what Shiz knew and when it knew it about the government's plans haunts the university community.</p>\n\n<p>Emperor Shell's regime views Gillikin with suspicion—too educated, too prone to asking questions. There have been quiet purges of university faculty, always with plausible official explanations. Fear is growing beneath the polished surface of Gillikinese society.</p>\n\n<h2>Hazards</h2>\n\n<h3>Environmental</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dense forests where travelers can easily become lost</li>\n<li>Harsh winters in the northern regions</li>\n<li>Wild animals (non-sentient) in remote areas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Social ostracism for violating class conventions</li>\n<li>Secret police monitoring university radicals</li>\n<li>Informants in academic and social circles</li>\n<li>Witch-hunters seeking forbidden magic users</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Creatures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bears (possibly Animals) in the forests</li>\n<li>Wolves in remote areas</li>\n<li>Grimmerie manifestations near places of power</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Random Encounters</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d12</th>\n<th>Encounter</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A Gillikinese noble traveling with guards, suspicious of strangers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>University students debating philosophy, happy to include travelers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>A maunt traveling alone, may offer sanctuary or information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-5</td>\n<td>Gale Force patrol checking papers and searching for Animal refugees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Merchants transporting purple dyes and fine fabrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>A wandering bear who may or may not be an Animal in hiding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>A wealthy family's carriage broken down, needing assistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>A witch-hunter questioning locals about magical activity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Farmers bringing goods to market, willing to trade or gossip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>An Animal refugee hiding in the woods, desperate for help</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Strange lights in the forest—magic, or something else?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A professor at Shiz has disappeared after discovering something in the restricted archives.

The region's emphasis on education and culture creates interesting roleplay opportunities, while the underlying injustice and collaboration with authoritarianism provide compelling conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>Use Gillikin to explore themes of privilege, complicity, and the responsibility of the educated. Characters may find themselves torn between the comfort of Gillikinese society and the moral imperative to resist injustice.</p>\n\n<p>The purple aesthetic can be visually striking in descriptions. Play up the contrast between the beautiful, refined surface of Gillikinese culture and the ugly realities it conceals.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese (Race)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Memory Jar",
      "content": "<h1>Memory Jar</h1>\n\n<p><em>2nd-level enchantment (Grimmerie)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"She kept her grief in a jar on the shelf, next to the dried lavender and the mouse bones. Some days she took it down and let herself remember. Most days, she was grateful to forget.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Spell Details</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>School</strong></td>\n<td>Enchantment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Casting Time</strong></td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Range</strong></td>\n<td>Touch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Components</strong></td>\n<td>V, S, M (a glass jar worth at least 10 gp)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Duration</strong></td>\n<td>Until dispelled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tradition</strong></td>\n<td>Grimmerie, Witch (Hedge)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>You touch a willing creature and extract a specific memory, storing it in a glass jar. The creature must concentrate on the memory they wish to remove while you cast this spell. The memory can be as short as a single moment or as long as one hour of continuous experience.</p>\n\n<p>Once the memory is extracted and stored in the jar, the creature no longer has any recollection of the events contained in that memory. The jar glows faintly with a color corresponding to the emotional content of the memory: warm gold for joy, deep blue for sadness, red for anger, green for envy, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>A creature can restore a memory by opening the jar and breathing in its contents (an action). The memory returns instantly and completely. Once restored, the jar becomes empty and nonmagical.</p>\n\n<p>If the jar is broken while containing a memory, the memory is lost forever and cannot be recovered by any means short of a <em>Wish</em> spell. The creature who lost the memory will never recall it, though they may be aware that something is missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can extract and store an additional hour of memories for each slot level above 2nd. These can be from the same creature or different willing creatures, but each memory requires its own jar.</p>\n\n<h2>Spell Lists</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adept</li>\n<li>Witch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Lore</h2>\n\n<p>The Memory Jar spell is ancient, predating even the Grimmerie's creation. Some scholars believe it originated with the Kumbric Witch, who is said to have stored millennia of memories in jars hidden throughout Oz. Others claim it was developed by grieving Quadling domingons who sought to ease the pain of loss.</p>\n\n<p>During the Wizard's reign, Memory Jar became a tool of oppression. Political prisoners were forced to surrender memories of resistance activities. Some were made to forget their own identities. The practice became so notorious that possession of a memory jar is now illegal in the Emerald City, punishable by imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the spell persists, used by those seeking to escape trauma, hide dangerous knowledge, or preserve precious moments. In the underground market, memory jars sell for enormous sums—particularly those containing the final moments of famous individuals or lost magical knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>There are disturbing rumors of collectors who steal others' memories, building vast libraries of experiences they can browse like books. Such individuals are hunted by both the authorities and those they've victimized.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Memory Jar is a spell with profound narrative implications. Use it sparingly and thoughtfully. A character who removes a traumatic memory doesn't heal from it—they simply no longer know it exists. This can lead to dangerous situations where they repeat past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the ethical questions: Is it right to remove a memory, even a painful one? What if that memory is crucial to someone's identity? What happens when a character discovers they've had memories removed without their knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>Memory jars make excellent quest objects. The party might need to recover a stolen memory jar, protect someone's hidden memories, or decide whether to restore a memory that might destroy someone they care about.</p>\n\n<p>The spell can also be used for information storage. An Adept might extract their knowledge of a powerful spell and hide it away, ensuring it doesn't die with them but also can't be tortured out of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creative Uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing knowledge of a secret location before being captured</li>\n<li>Storing happy memories to revisit during dark times</li>\n<li>Hiding evidence of a crime</li>\n<li>Creating a false alibi (\"I don't remember where I was that night\")</li>\n<li>Preserving the memories of the dying</li>\n<li>Trading memories as currency in certain underground markets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Limitations and Considerations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The spell requires a willing subject—forcing someone to forget is a different, darker magic</li>\n<li>Breaking a memory jar is permanent destruction</li>\n<li>Some memories are too large or too fundamental to identity to be removed</li>\n<li>Removing a memory doesn't remove skills or knowledge gained from it, leading to strange gaps in understanding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/memory-jar-filled', 'Memory Jar (Filled)'); return false;\">Memory Jar (Magic Item)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/oz-specific/memory-rot', 'Memory Rot'); return false;\">Memory Rot (Condition)</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Shiz Dropout",
      "content": "<h1>Shiz Dropout</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I left before they could expel me. Better to walk away than be thrown out, my father always said. He stopped saying much of anything to me after that.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>You were a student at Shiz University, the most prestigious institution of learning in all of Oz. Whether you studied for a single semester or made it nearly to graduation, something happened that ended your academic career. Perhaps you were expelled for unauthorized magical experimentation, or you discovered a truth too dangerous to ignore. Maybe you simply couldn't afford the tuition, or the politics of academic life proved too much to stomach. Whatever the reason, you left Shiz before earning your degree.</p>\n\n<p>This background carries both privilege and shame. You received enough education to set you apart from common folk, learning skills and making connections that will serve you for life. But you also bear the stigma of failure in Gillikinese society, where a Shiz education is the key to advancement. Your family may have been disappointed or furious. Your former friends may have abandoned you. Yet you've also seen behind the curtain of Oz's intellectual elite, and you know that their refinement often masks corruption and cowardice.</p>\n\n<p>Many Shiz dropouts become adventurers, using the skills they learned to make their way in a world that has closed its doors to them. Some seek to prove they were right to leave. Others hunt for redemption, hoping to finish what they started or right the wrongs that drove them away.</p>\n\n<h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2>\n\n<p>Choose two from: Arcana, History, Investigation, Persuasion</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Proficiencies</h2>\n\n<p>Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument</p>\n\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n\n<p>One of your choice (academic study)</p>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A set of fine clothes (purple-trimmed, slightly worn)</li>\n<li>A Shiz University scarf or pin (you couldn't quite bring yourself to throw it away)</li>\n<li>A letter from someone you left behind (friend, rival, or lover)</li>\n<li>One academic book from your studies</li>\n<li>A belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Feature: Academic Network</h2>\n\n<p>Despite leaving Shiz, you still have connections in academic circles throughout Oz. When you're in a settlement with a library, university, or scholarly institution, you can gain access to academic resources and seek out learned individuals who might help you—for old times' sake, shared intellectual interests, or in exchange for interesting information.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you can usually identify fellow Shiz students or alumni on sight, recognizing the subtle markers of Shiz culture (speech patterns, fashion choices, mannerisms). Whether they'll be friendly or hostile depends on the circumstances and how you left, but at least you'll know you're dealing with someone from your world.</p>\n\n<h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2>\n\n<p>Shiz dropouts are shaped by their incomplete education and the circumstances of their departure. Some are bitter about what they lost. Others are relieved to be free of academic constraints. All carry the weight of unfinished business.</p>\n\n<h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I correct people's grammar and pronunciation without thinking.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I'm more comfortable with books than people.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>I name-drop my time at Shiz constantly, even though I didn't finish.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I'm suspicious of authority figures, especially academic ones.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I have a chip on my shoulder about not having a degree.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>I collect knowledge obsessively, trying to fill the gaps in my education.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>I'm surprisingly practical for someone with a Shiz background.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>I hide my Shiz past, ashamed of both the privilege and the failure.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Ideals</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Truth matters more than degrees or social standing.

When not being worn, they fold flat and can easily be tucked into a pocket or pack.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>The Silver Slippers are one of several pairs of magical shoes known to exist in Oz, though perhaps not as famous as the Ruby Slippers that once belonged to Nessarose Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the East. The origins of these silver shoes are mysterious—some claim they were crafted by the Gnome King of Ev, while others believe they're a creation of Lurline herself, gifts left behind when she departed Oz.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers have passed through many hands over the centuries. They were once owned by a wealthy Gillikinese merchant who used them to build a trading empire, appearing in distant markets overnight. A Quadling resistance leader wore them during the genocide, saving dozens of refugees by transporting them to safety. Most recently, they were held in the private collection of a noble family until they were stolen—or perhaps rescued—by person or persons unknown.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n\n<h3>Swift Travel</h3>\n<p>While wearing these slippers, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you ignore difficult terrain when walking.</p>\n\n<h3>Seven-League Stride</h3>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can activate the slippers' power by clicking your heels together three times and concentrating on a location you can visualize. You must have been to this location before, or have seen it clearly in a crystal ball, scrying pool, or similar divination. When you activate this power, you teleport to that location, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space if your intended destination is blocked.</p>\n\n<p>The teleportation can cross any distance within Oz, but it cannot cross the Deadly Desert or travel to other planes of existence. If you attempt to teleport somewhere you cannot reach, the magic fails but is not expended.</p>\n\n<h3>Always Steady</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to avoid being knocked prone or moved against your will. Your feet find purchase where others would slip and fall.</p>\n\n<h2>Attunement</h2>\n\n<p>To attune to the Silver Slippers, you must wear them for one hour while walking a path that matters to you—toward something you seek or away from something you flee. During this time, you must think about where you truly belong in the world. The slippers will attune to you if they judge you worthy, though their criteria for worthiness remain mysterious.</p>\n\n<p>Once attuned, only you can wear the slippers. They will not fit anyone else until your attunement ends.</p>\n\n<h2>Lore & Legends</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Common Knowledge:</strong> Most people in Oz have heard stories of magical shoes that can transport their wearer great distances. The tales often involve someone desperately wishing to go home and finding themselves there with three clicks of their heels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rumors:</strong> Some claim that the Silver Slippers can cross the Deadly Desert, though this has never been proven. Others whisper that wearing them draws the attention of powerful beings who covet such items. There's a persistent story that the slippers will eventually take their wearer somewhere they don't expect—home, but not the home they imagined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Misconceptions:</strong> Many believe the slippers will take you anywhere you want to go with a simple wish. In truth, the magic is more limited and requires genuine knowledge of your destination. Some think the slippers are indestructible, but they can be damaged or destroyed like any magical item—it's simply very difficult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>True Secrets:</strong> The Silver Slippers were created by Lurline as a fail-safe, intended to allow her chosen champions to retreat from danger or reach places of power quickly. They respond not just to where you want to go, but to where you need to be. On rare occasions, the slippers have taken their wearers somewhere other than their intended destination, always to a place where they were desperately needed—or where they needed to be for their own growth.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers also have a defensive property that few discover: if someone attempts to forcibly remove them from an attuned wearer, the slippers teleport both the wearer and themselves to a place the wearer thinks of as safe.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Silver Slippers are powerful but not game-breaking. The once-per-long-rest teleportation is significant but limited, making it a strategic resource rather than a constant escape hatch. Use the slippers to enable dramatic moments—rescues, last-second escapes, or surprise appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Consider having the slippers' teleportation be imperfect in interesting ways. Perhaps the wearer arrives at their destination exhausted, or the magic attracts attention. Maybe crossing certain magical boundaries (like the wards around Kiamo Ko or the Emerald City) requires a saving throw or causes complications.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers work well as a quest reward or a contested object. Multiple factions might want them, leading to interesting choices for the party. Do they keep them, sell them, give them to someone in need, or destroy them to keep them out of dangerous hands?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Versions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Silver Slippers (Rare):</strong> Can teleport twice per long rest and grant a +1 bonus to AC</li>\n<li><strong>Tarnished Silver Slippers (Common):</strong> Only grant the Swift Travel property, no teleportation</li>\n<li><strong>Silver Dancing Shoes (Uncommon):</strong> Focus on movement in combat, granting extra movement and the ability to disengage as a bonus action</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/ruby-slippers', 'Ruby Slippers'); return false;\">Ruby Slippers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/nessarose-thropp', 'Nessarose Thropp'); return false;\">Nessarose Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/rare/emerald-city-shoes', 'Emerald City Shoes'); return false;\">Emerald City Shoes</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "The Gale Force",
      "content": "<h1>The Gale Force</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"We serve Oz. That's what they tell us, and we repeat it until we believe it. But who is Oz? The Palace? The Emperor? The Emerald City that wouldn't exist without us keeping order in the provinces? Serve Oz long enough, and you stop asking questions like that.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is the military arm of the Ozian government, serving as both army and internal security force. Established during the Wizard's reign and expanded dramatically under Emperor Shell, the Gale Force maintains order throughout Oz—or imposes it, depending on your perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Named for Dorothy Gale, the outsider whose arrival precipitated the Wizard's fall, the Gale Force represents Oz's attempt to control the chaos that followed. They are soldiers, police, border guards, and enforcers. In the Emerald City, they maintain a visible but relatively restrained presence. In the provinces, particularly Munchkinland and Quadling Country, they are an occupying force.</p>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is complicated. Most soldiers are ordinary people trying to make a living and maintain order. Some genuinely believe they're protecting Oz from chaos and external threats. Others are just following orders, too afraid or too indoctrinated to question them. And some—a terrifying minority—have found that the Gale Force gives them power over others, and they enjoy wielding it.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<h3>Primary Goal</h3>\n<p>Maintain the stability and territorial integrity of Oz under the authority of the Palace, currently Emperor Shell's government. This includes suppressing rebellion, controlling borders, enforcing laws, and protecting Ozian interests.</p>\n\n<h3>Secondary Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enforce Animal registration and control policies</li>\n<li>Suppress the Munchkinland independence movement and maintain Ozian authority in contested territories</li>\n<li>Monitor and control the practice of unauthorized magic</li>\n<li>Protect trade routes and economic interests</li>\n<li>Gather intelligence on threats to the state</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Hidden Agenda</h3>\n<p>The highest levels of the Gale Force are aware that Emperor Shell's grip on power is tenuous. They are preparing contingencies for potential succession crises, civil war, or the complete collapse of central authority. Some commanders have already begun establishing personal power bases, ensuring that if Oz falls apart, they'll control whatever comes next.</p>\n\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force is commanded by the Lord General, who reports directly to the Palace. Below the Lord General are four Regional Commanders, each responsible for operations in one of the four provinces. The Emerald City garrison has its own commander who holds equivalent rank to the Regional Commanders.</p>\n\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lord General</strong> - Overall commander</li>\n<li><strong>Regional Commander</strong> - Province-level command</li>\n<li><strong>Colonel</strong> - Commands multiple battalions</li>\n<li><strong>Major</strong> - Commands a battalion (400-600 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Captain</strong> - Commands a company (100-150 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong> - Second-in-command of a company</li>\n<li><strong>Sergeant</strong> - Commands a squad (10-15 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Corporal</strong> - Assists sergeants</li>\n<li><strong>Private</strong> - Enlisted soldier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Special units (Dragon Corps, Animal Processing Division, Intelligence) have parallel command structures with their own specialized ranks.</p>\n\n<h3>Membership</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force recruits through a combination of voluntary enlistment and conscription. Enlistment offers steady pay, training, and social status—valuable in a uncertain economy. Conscription targets young men from the provinces, particularly from families unable to pay the exemption fee.</p>\n\n<p>Total strength is estimated at 25,000-30,000 soldiers, though exact numbers are classified. The war with Free Munchkinland has strained these numbers, leading to increased conscription and retention of soldiers past their service terms.</p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<h3>Financial</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force consumes approximately 40% of the Ozian government's budget. Funding comes from taxation, tariffs, confiscation of property from enemies of the state, and the sale of goods produced in prison labor camps. Recent war expenses have strained these resources, leading to delayed pay and supply shortages in some units.</p>\n\n<h3>Military</h3>\n<p>Standard infantry armament includes crossbows, swords, pikes, and medium armor. Cavalry units are small but effective. Special units include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dragon Corps</strong> - Soldiers who ride or direct dragons in combat (highly dangerous, high casualties)</li>\n<li><strong>Siege Engineers</strong> - Specialists in fortification and breaking fortifications</li>\n<li><strong>Witch Hunters</strong> - Trained to combat magical threats</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force maintains an extensive network of informants throughout Oz. They monitor suspicious activity, infiltrate resistance groups, and report on public sentiment. This intelligence apparatus works closely with the Menaciers, Emperor Shell's secret police, though there is significant rivalry between the two organizations.</p>\n\n<h3>Magical</h3>\n<p>Limited. The Gale Force employs a small number of Adepts and Unionists for magical support, but Emperor Shell distrusts magic and has kept these numbers deliberately low. Access to magical items is restricted to officers and special units. The Dragon Corps represents the most significant magical asset, though controlling dragons is as dangerous to the Gale Force as to their enemies.</p>\n\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force's political influence is substantial. Many officers are from Gillikinese aristocratic families, creating connections between military and civilian power. In the provinces, Gale Force commanders often have more practical authority than civilian administrators. However, Emperor Shell has carefully prevented the military from becoming too independent, maintaining rival power centers to keep them in check.</p>\n\n<h2>Notable Members</h2>\n\n<h3>Commander Cherrystone - Regional Commander, Munchkinland</h3>\n<p>A career soldier who rose through the ranks on merit. Cherrystone is efficient, disciplined, and capable of great cruelty in service to what he sees as duty. He genuinely believes the Munchkinland independence movement threatens Oz's survival and has prosecuted the war with ruthless determination. His effectiveness makes him valuable; his methods make him controversial even within the Gale Force.</p>\n\n<h3>Captain Trism bon Cavalish - Intelligence Officer</h3>\n<p>A young officer from a minor aristocratic family, Trism is intelligent and increasingly troubled by what he's been ordered to do. He's seen Animal families torn apart, witnessed interrogations, and carried out orders he knows are wrong. He hasn't acted on his doubts yet, but he's a man in crisis—which makes him both a potential ally and a security risk.</p>\n\n<h3>Sergeant Kells - Veteran Enlisted</h3>\n<p>Twenty years in the Gale Force has made Kells cynical but competent. She keeps her head down, follows orders, and gets her squad through their assignments with minimal casualties. She doesn't ask questions about the bigger picture because she learned long ago that questions only bring trouble. Her soldiers respect her because she keeps them alive, not because she's inspiring.</p>\n\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n\n<h3>Allies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Palace:</strong> The Gale Force serves the government, though the relationship is more transactional than ideological for many soldiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Unionist Church (Orthodox):</strong> The Church provides moral authority and chaplains for the Gale Force. In return, the military protects Church interests and enforces religious law.</li>\n<li><strong>Gillikinese Aristocracy:</strong> Many officers are from noble families, creating natural alliances with the ruling class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Rivals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Menaciers:</strong> Shell's secret police compete with the Gale Force for funding, influence, and the Emperor's favor. Both organizations spy on each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Provincial Governments:</strong> Local administrators resent military interference in civilian matters, while the Gale Force views civilians as soft and ineffective.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Enemies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free Munchkinland Forces:</strong> Open warfare in the east, with atrocities committed on both sides.</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Resistance:</strong> The Gale Force's enforcement of Animal registration makes them the primary enemy of Animal rights activists.</li>\n<li><strong>Quadling Guerrillas:</strong> Insurgents in the south wage a slow-burn war against Gale Force occupation.</li>\n<li><strong>Various Resistance Groups:</strong> Anyone opposing the government views the Gale Force as the fist of oppression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Presence in Oz</h2>\n\n<h3>Headquarters</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force command is based in the Palace District of the Emerald City, in a fortress-like complex that also houses training facilities, armories, and administrative offices.</p>\n\n<h3>Territory</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force maintains bases, outposts, and patrols throughout Oz. Their presence is heaviest in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Munchkinland:</strong> Occupation forces engaged in active warfare</li>\n<li><strong>Quadling Country:</strong> Garrison forces maintaining control over a resentful population</li>\n<li><strong>Major Trade Routes:</strong> Protection against bandits and smugglers</li>\n<li><strong>Border Regions:</strong> Preventing unauthorized crossings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Operations</h3>\n<p>Day-to-day activities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patrols and checkpoints</li>\n<li>Enforcing Animal registration</li>\n<li>Hunting fugitives and rebels</li>\n<li>Protecting government installations</li>\n<li>Conducting raids on suspected resistance safe houses</li>\n<li>Escorting government officials and valuable shipments</li>\n<li>Training new recruits</li>\n<li>Combat operations in Munchkinland</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Joining the Gale Force</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Physically capable, no history of treason or serious crime, loyalty to Oz (as tested by officers who may themselves be unreliable)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Process:</strong> Enlistment involves an oath ceremony, basic training (three months), and assignment to a unit. Officers are typically drawn from the aristocracy or promoted from enlisted ranks after proving themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steady pay (when the government has funds)</li>\n<li>Food, shelter, and equipment provided</li>\n<li>Social status (in some communities)</li>\n<li>Skills training</li>\n<li>Access to military courts (separate from civilian justice)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Obligations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow all orders from superior officers</li>\n<li>Minimum service term (typically 4 years, extended during wartime)</li>\n<li>Subject to military law and discipline</li>\n<li>Can be assigned anywhere in Oz</li>\n<li>Expected to enforce all government policies, including those regarding Animals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ranks and Advancement:</strong> Promotion is based on time in service, performance, connections, and (increasingly) willingness to do unpleasant work. Officers from aristocratic backgrounds advance faster. Enlisted soldiers can reach sergeant through competence; further promotion is rare without patronage.</p>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A Gale Force officer approaches the party with evidence that their commander is selling military supplies on the black market. Helping them could make powerful enemies—or allies.</li>\n<li>The party witnesses the Gale Force preparing to raid an Animal safe house. Do they intervene, warn the Animals, or look the other way?</li>\n<li>A deserter from the Gale Force begs the party for help escaping Oz. They carry secrets that could damage the government—if they survive long enough to share them.</li>\n<li>The party is conscripted into the Gale Force and must complete their service term (or find a way out) while navigating military politics and moral dilemmas.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Gale Force should be complex, not cartoonishly evil. They're people doing a job in a broken system. Some are true believers, some are opportunists, most are just trying to survive. Use them to explore themes of complicity, duty versus morality, and the banality of evil.</p>\n\n<p>Individual soldiers can be allies, enemies, or anything in between. A Gale Force patrol might let the party go with a warning, share information about threats ahead, or turn a blind eye to small infractions. This makes encounters with them tense and unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the psychological toll of service. Soldiers who've enforced Animal registration or fought in Munchkinland carry trauma. Some drink too much, some have nightmares, some have stopped feeling anything. These human details make them more than just obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is also an opportunity for redemption arcs. A soldier who begins to question their orders can become a powerful ally, bringing inside knowledge and resources to the resistance—at tremendous personal cost.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-menaciers', 'The Menaciers'); return false;\">The Menaciers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/free-munchkinland', 'Free Munchkinland'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Elphaba Thropp",
      "content": "<h1>Elphaba Thropp</h1>\n\n<p><em>Munchkinlander Human, Adept (Reader) 18, Chaotic Good (or Neutral Good, or just Chaotic)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I'm wicked through and through, they say. But I've never made someone disappear who didn't threaten Animals first. I've never tortured confessions or drained marshes or Silenced anyone. So who, exactly, is wicked?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>At a Glance</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Revolutionary, Witch, Symbol of Resistance (depending on era and perspective)</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Kiamo Ko (in later life), various locations during her activist years, deceased by the time of most campaigns (but her legacy endures)</p>\n<p><strong>Attitude:</strong> Hostile to authority, protective of the oppressed, deeply distrustful but capable of fierce loyalty to those she loves</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba's most striking feature is her green skin—a deep emerald that caused her mother to scream when she was born. Her eyes are dark and intense, her hair black and wild. She is tall and angular, with sharp features that some find harsh and others find compelling. In her youth, she dressed practically, favoring dark colors that didn't show dirt. Later, she embraced the pointed hat and dramatic black clothing that people expected from the \"Wicked Witch.\"</p>\n\n<p>She moves with purpose and energy, often seeming to take up more space than her physical form suggests. When angry or casting magic, her green skin seems to darken and her eyes flash. In rare moments of peace, her face softens, revealing the person she might have been in a kinder world.</p>\n\n<p>She has an aversion to water—it pains her skin, making bathing difficult and rain miserable. This has contributed to her reputation for uncleanliness, though in truth she's meticulous about hygiene within the limits her condition allows.</p>\n\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba is brilliant, passionate, and profoundly angry at injustice. She cannot look away from suffering, even when doing so would be easier or safer. This moral clarity is both her greatest strength and her fatal flaw—she will sacrifice anything, including herself, for what she believes is right.</p>\n\n<p>She is not easy to like. She's prickly, judgmental, and often fails to understand social niceties. She says what she thinks without cushioning it, and she has little patience for those who prioritize comfort over justice. Yet those who earn her trust discover a fierce friend capable of great tenderness, particularly toward Animals, children, and the marginalized.</p>\n\n<p>Her relationship with power is complex. She craves the ability to change things, but she despises authority and those who wield it selfishly. The Grimmerie offers her tremendous power, but reading it is slowly destroying her. She knows this and does it anyway, because what else can she do in the face of such overwhelming evil?</p>\n\n<p>Underneath the anger is tremendous pain. She's lonely, convinced she's unlovable because of her green skin. She's mourning—for Dr. Dillamond, for Fiyero, for all the Animals who've suffered, for the person she might have been. She's also consumed by guilt over the things she's done, the people she's hurt, the moral lines she's crossed.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>Born to Frex, a Unionist minister, and Melena Thropp in Munchkinland's Rush Margins, Elphaba's green skin marked her as different from birth. Her father saw her as punishment for his wife's sins. Her mother drowned her sorrows in wine and fantasy. Only her nanny, Nanny, showed her affection.</p>\n\n<p>At Shiz University, Elphaba studied sorcery under Madame Morrible while pursuing a degree in life sciences. She befriended (and was changed by) Dr. Dillamond, a Goat professor whose research into Animal consciousness was deemed dangerous by the authorities. His murder radicalized her, setting her on a path of resistance against the Wizard's regime.</p>\n\n<p>Her complicated relationship with Glinda Upland—roommate, friend, rival, and perhaps something more—shaped both their lives. Where Elphaba chose resistance, Glinda chose accommodation, becoming \"Glinda the Good\" and working within the system. Their divergent paths haunt them both.</p>\n\n<p>Elphaba's affair with Fiyero, an Arjiki prince, gave her one of the few genuine connections of her life. His apparent death devastated her, though rumors persist that she saved him through magic at a terrible cost.</p>\n\n<p>In her later years, she retreated to Kiamo Ko in the Vinkus, raising Fiyero's children and studying the Grimmerie. She became the Wicked Witch of the West in truth, though whether she was wicked or simply desperate remains a matter of perspective. Her apparent death at Dorothy Gale's hands became myth, but like everything about Elphaba, the truth is more complicated.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals & Motivations</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Current Goals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect Animals from persecution and restore their rights</li>\n<li>Understand and master the Grimmerie's magic, despite the cost</li>\n<li>Undermine the Wizard's (later the Emperor's) authority</li>\n<li>Keep those she loves safe, even if it means pushing them away</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Long-term Ambitions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overthrow the corrupt government and establish a just society</li>\n<li>Uncover the truth about Oz's history and the sources of magic</li>\n<li>Prove that she is not wicked, or at least that wickedness is more complex than good and evil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Fears:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure—that all her sacrifices will accomplish nothing</li>\n<li>That she really is wicked, that power has corrupted her as it corrupts everyone</li>\n<li>Water, which burns her skin</li>\n<li>Losing those few people she loves</li>\n<li>That the Grimmerie will consume her before she can finish her work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Elphaba Thropp</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Voice & Manner:</strong> Sharp, precise, often sarcastic. She speaks quickly when passionate, which is often. Her voice can be harsh, but it can also be gentle with those she trusts. She has a tendency to lecture when she feels strongly about something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quirks:</strong> Avoids water compulsively. Touches her hat when nervous. Quotes Dr. Dillamond frequently. Has a nervous habit of checking that her spellbook is still in her bag.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Phrases:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Because I cannot do good, must I therefore do nothing?\"</li>\n<li>\"They call me wicked. Fine. I'll be wicked on my own terms.\"</li>\n<li>\"Dr. Dillamond used to say...\"</li>\n<li>\"You don't understand what they're doing to Animals out there!\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Interaction Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>She responds well to directness and poorly to flattery</li>\n<li>Mention Animal rights positively and you'll have her attention</li>\n<li>She respects competence and commitment over charm</li>\n<li>Don't mention her green skin unless you want an icy response</li>\n<li>Show her evidence of injustice and she'll feel compelled to act</li>\n<li>She's more vulnerable than she appears—kindness catches her off-guard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Stats (if needed for combat)</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Elphaba Thropp</h2>\n<p><em>Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 15 (Mage Armor)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 99 (18d6 + 36)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following Adept spells prepared:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrips (at will): <em>Green-Light, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost</em></li>\n<li>1st level (4 slots): <em>Detect Magic, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield</em></li>\n<li>2nd level (3 slots): <em>Levitate, Memory Jar, Invisibility</em></li>\n<li>3rd level (3 slots): <em>Counterspell, Fly, Dispel Magic</em></li>\n<li>4th level (3 slots): <em>Polymorph, Greater Invisibility, Banishment</em></li>\n<li>5th level (3 slots): <em>Telekinesis, Wall of Force, Dominate Person</em></li>\n<li>6th level (1 slot): <em>Globe of Invulnerability, Chain Lightning</em></li>\n<li>7th level (1 slot): <em>Reverse Gravity, Teleport</em></li>\n<li>8th level (1 slot): <em>Demiplane, Power Word Stun</em></li>\n<li>9th level (1 slot): <em>Time Stop, Wish (extremely rare, dangerous)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Grimmerie Corruption.</em></strong> Elphaba has read deeply from the Grimmerie. She can cast any spell she knows at one level higher without using a higher-level slot, but when she does, she takes 1d6 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Water Vulnerability.</em></strong> Contact with water deals 1d4 acid damage per round to Elphaba. Full immersion would be lethal. She cannot swim and avoids rain when possible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Witch-Mark.</em></strong> Elphaba's green skin makes her instantly recognizable and grants her advantage on Intimidation checks against those who fear magic, but disadvantage on Persuasion checks with most people.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Grimmerie Blast.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 5) force damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Flying Monkeys.</em></strong> Once per day, if Elphaba possesses the Golden Cap, she can summon 2d6 flying monkeys to serve her for one hour.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Shield.</em></strong> When hit by an attack, Elphaba can cast <em>Shield</em> as a reaction, increasing her AC by 5 until the start of her next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Counterspell.</em></strong> When a creature within 60 feet casts a spell, Elphaba can attempt to counter it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Quest Hooks</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Quests She Might Offer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"I need you to smuggle this family of Animal refugees to safety. The Gale Force is hunting them, and I can't be seen helping—it would endanger too many others.\"</li>\n<li>\"There's a Grimmerie fragment in the Emerald City archives. Get it for me before it falls into the wrong hands. I'll teach you a spell in exchange.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Quests Involving Her:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The party is hired to hunt \"the Wicked Witch of the West.\" When they find her, they discover she's protecting Animal orphans from the Gale Force. What do they do?</li>\n<li>Elphaba appears to the party in a time of crisis, offering help—but accepting it means making an enemy of the government. Her aid comes with consequences.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Glinda Upland:</strong> Former roommate and complicated friend. They haven't spoken in years, but each thinks of the other often. Love, resentment, regret, and understanding all tangled together.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiyero:</strong> Her great love, whose fate is uncertain. She either mourns him or has saved him in a way that makes their relationship impossible.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wizard/Emperor Shell:</strong> Her enemy, the embodiment of corrupt authority</li>\n<li><strong>Dr. Dillamond:</strong> Dead mentor whose murder set her on this path. She carries his watch.</li>\n<li><strong>Madame Morrible:</strong> Former teacher turned enemy, manipulator who used her</li>\n<li><strong>Nessarose (sister):</strong> Complicated relationship, guilt over her sister's fate</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Resistance:</strong> Ally and sometimes leader, though she works mostly alone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba is one of Oz's most significant figures, but use her carefully. She can overshadow player characters if overused. Consider these approaches:</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Legend:</strong> She's already dead by the campaign's start, but her legacy shapes everything. The party encounters people she saved, those she hurt, places she marked, and the ongoing consequences of her choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Distant Ally:</strong> She helps the party indirectly—leaving information, creating diversions, sending messages through intermediaries. They know she exists but rarely meet her.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Moral Center:</strong> The party encounters her once or twice at crucial moments. She challenges their assumptions, asks difficult questions, and forces them to consider what they're willing to sacrifice for justice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Antagonist:</strong> If your campaign is from the government's perspective or explores moral ambiguity, Elphaba can be an opponent. She's not evil, but her methods are extreme, and her attacks on government facilities endanger innocent people.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that Elphaba is a person, not a symbol. She makes mistakes, hurts people she loves, and sometimes chooses poorly. She's consumed by her cause in ways that aren't always healthy. She can be wrong. This complexity makes her compelling.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/kiamo-ko', 'Kiamo Ko'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/glinda-upland', 'Glinda Upland'); return false;\">Glinda Upland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a></li>\n</ul>",
