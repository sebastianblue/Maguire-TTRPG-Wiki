      "content": "<h1>Gillikinese</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The Gillikinese have always believed themselves the natural aristocracy of Oz\u2014educated, refined, and conveniently forgetful of how that refinement was purchased.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Gillikinese are the human inhabitants of Gillikin, the northern province of Oz. Distinguished by their purple-hued fashion and their long-standing emphasis on education and refinement, they represent the intellectual and aristocratic elite of Oz. Shiz University, located in Gillikin, has been the premier institution of learning in Oz for centuries, and Gillikinese culture revolves around academic achievement, social status, and the preservation of tradition.</p>\n\n<p>However, beneath this polished exterior lies a complex history. The Gillikinese aristocracy built their wealth and status through the exploitation of Animals and the lower classes, though many prefer to focus on their cultural contributions rather than examine the foundations of their privilege. The region's history with Animal rights activism, particularly surrounding Shiz University, has created deep divisions within Gillikinese society.</p>\n\n<p>Modern Gillikinese find themselves torn between tradition and change. Some cling to the old ways, while others question the systems that gave their ancestors power. This internal conflict makes Gillikinese characters particularly interesting to play, as they often struggle with privilege, education, and moral responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Gillikinese mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Gillikinese range from 5 to 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), plus one of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Gillikinese Education</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from: Arcana, History, Investigation, or Religion. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Social Graces</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with Gillikinese nobility or academic institutions. You also have proficiency with one musical instrument or artisan's tools of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Purple Heritage</h3>\n<p>The purple landscapes of Gillikin have left their mark. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, representing the Gillikinese tradition of emotional restraint and intellectual control.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikinese society is stratified by education and family lineage. The highest echelons are occupied by graduates of Shiz University and their descendants, while skilled craftspeople, merchants, and farmers make up the middle and lower classes. Social mobility is possible through education, but access to Shiz is often dependent on family connections and wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Purple is the signature color of Gillikin, appearing in everything from clothing to architecture. Wearing purple\u2014particularly deep, rich shades\u2014is a status symbol. The aristocracy tends toward violet and royal purple, while commoners wear lighter lavenders and mauves.</p>\n\n<p>Intellectual pursuits are highly valued. A Gillikinese who cannot engage in philosophical debate or lacks knowledge of history and the arts is considered uncultured, regardless of their wealth. Many Gillikinese homes contain extensive libraries, and literacy rates are higher in Gillikin than anywhere else in Oz.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Avaric, Crope, Tibbett, Boq, Frexspar</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Glinda, Pfannee, Shenshen, Milla, Thessaly</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Arduenna, Tigelaar, Upland, Tenmeadows</p>\n\n<p>Gillikinese often use initials or shortened versions of their names in casual settings, but full names are used in formal situations. Triple-barreled surnames are common among the aristocracy.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Gillikinese</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I believe every problem can be solved through reason and education.</li>\n<li>I unconsciously judge others by their grammar and vocabulary.</li>\n<li>I collect books and can't resist visiting libraries wherever I go.</li>\n<li>I struggle to express emotion openly, preferring intellectual discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Education is the path to enlightenment and progress. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition.</strong> The old ways have endured for good reason. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Reform.</strong> The systems that built Gillikin's success are fundamentally unjust. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Excellence.</strong> Mediocrity is unacceptable in any endeavor. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's reputation is everything to me.</li>\n<li>I owe my education to a mentor who saw potential in me.</li>\n<li>I seek to restore my family's lost fortune/status.</li>\n<li>A book I read changed my life, and I seek its author.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I assume I'm the smartest person in the room.</li>\n<li>I struggle to relate to those without formal education.</li>\n<li>I'm ashamed of my family's history with Animal exploitation.</li>\n<li>I value appearance and status more than I'd like to admit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikinese characters work well as party intellectuals, diplomats, or reformed aristocrats grappling with privilege. Their educational background makes them natural scholars, wizards, or bards. Consider having them struggle with the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notable Gillikinese NPCs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glinda Upland - The Good Witch, social climber turned leader</li>\n<li>Avaric Tenmeadows - Wealthy student, opportunist</li>\n<li>Crope and Tibbett - Scholars at Shiz, partners in research and life</li>\n<li>Madame Morrible - Headmistress of Shiz, dangerous manipulator</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Plot Hooks:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The party is hired to recover a rare book stolen from a Gillikinese library.</li>\n<li>A Gillikinese noble seeks redemption by aiding Animal refugees.</li>\n<li>Ancient secrets in the Shiz University archives hold the key to the campaign's mystery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n</ul>",

It's meant to be survived\u2014and only if you're clever enough to read what was never meant to be read.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Adept is one who has glimpsed the deeper magics of Oz\u2014the forbidden knowledge inscribed in the Grimmerie, passed down through whispers of the Kumbric tradition, or channeled through ancient Quadling rites. Unlike the natural magic of witches or the faith-driven power of Unionists, the Adept's power comes from study, discipline, and often dangerous bargains with forces beyond mortal ken.</p>\n\n<p>To become an Adept is to walk a knife's edge between power and corruption. The Grimmerie itself is said to change those who read it, twisting their bodies and minds even as it grants them unimaginable abilities. Many Adepts hide their practice, knowing that the Emerald City's authorities\u2014and the Unionist Church\u2014would see them burned as witches.</p>\n\n<p>Some Adepts are scholars who stumbled onto forbidden texts. Others are desperate souls seeking power to right wrongs. Still others are driven by pure curiosity, willing to risk everything to understand the fundamental nature of Oz's magic.</p>\n\n<h2>Class Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hit

(Detailed)</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting (Level 1)</h3>\n<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells drawn from the Grimmerie tradition and other forbidden sources.</p>\n\n<h3>Grimmerie Lore (Level 1)</h3>\n<p>You can read magical script that would be incomprehensible to others. You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to identify spells, decipher magical writing, or understand the nature of magical effects. Additionally, you can cast <em>Detect Magic</em> as a ritual without having it prepared.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch-Mark (Level 3)</h3>\n<p>Extended exposure to forbidden magic has left its mark on you. Choose one physical manifestation: unusual eye color (green-tinged skin like Elphaba's is rare), hair that moves of its own accord, eyes that occasionally glow when casting, or fingers stained with magical ink. This mark gives you advantage on Intimidation checks against those who fear magic, but disadvantage on Persuasion checks with Unionists and witch-hunters.</p>\n\n<h3>Spell Mastery (Level 18)</h3>\n<p>You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose one 1st-level Adept spell and one 2nd-level Adept spell. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot.</p>\n\n<h3>Signature Spell (Level 20)</h3>\n<p>Choose one 3rd-level Adept spell as your signature spell. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Adept Traditions</h2>\n\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose a tradition that shapes your practice of magic.</p>\n\n<h3>The Reader</h3>\n\n<p>You have gained access to pages from the Grimmerie itself, or other texts of comparable power. Your magic is raw, dangerous, and incredibly potent.</p>\n\n<h4>Reader Features</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adept Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Direct Reading, Grimmerie Fragment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Empowered Casting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Corruption Resistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Reality Rewriting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h5>Direct Reading (Level 2)</h5>\n<p>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to read directly from the Grimmerie (or your fragment). The spell is cast at one level higher than the slot expended, but you take 1d6 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented.</p>\n\n<h5>Empowered Casting (Level 6)</h5>\n<p>When you use Direct Reading, you can reroll any number of the spell's damage dice once.</p>\n\n<h5>Corruption Resistance (Level 10)</h5>\n<p>Your extended exposure to the Grimmerie has hardened you against its effects. You have resistance to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical effects that would transform or corrupt you.</p>\n\n<h5>Reality Rewriting (Level 14)</h5>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can read from the deepest pages. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower, you can change its target, range, or area of effect to something dramatically different, subject to DM approval. This always deals 5d6 necrotic damage to you.</p>\n\n<h3>The Domingon</h3>\n\n<p>You follow the Quadling tradition of trance magic, communicating with spirits and drawing power from the deep places of Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Domingon Features</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adept Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Trance State, Spirit Speech</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Deep Trance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Spirit Guardian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Prophetic Vision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h5>Trance State (Level 2)</h5>\n<p>You can enter a meditative trance as a bonus action. While in this state, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws and can sense the presence of spirits within 60 feet. You can maintain this trance for up to 10 minutes, and can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) per long rest.</p>\n\n<h5>Deep Trance (Level 6)</h5>\n<p>While in your Trance State, you can cast <em>Speak with Dead</em> without expending a spell slot once per long rest.</p>\n\n<h5>Spirit Guardian (Level 10)</h5>\n<p>You have formed a bond with a spirit of the Quadling marshes. Once per long rest, you can summon this spirit to protect you. For 1 minute, the spirit grants you +2 to AC and you have advantage on death saving throws.</p>\n\n<h5>Prophetic Vision (Level 14)</h5>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can enter a prophetic trance. For 10 minutes, you experience visions of possible futures. The DM provides you with three glimpses of events that might occur in the next 24 hours, though which (if any) come to pass depends on the choices made.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intelligence 13</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies Gained:</strong> Light armor, one skill from the Adept skill list</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Adept class represents the dangerous pursuit of arcane knowledge in Oz. Unlike traditional wizards, Adepts are drawing on sources of magic that actively corrupt and change them. Consider the physical and psychological toll of their power.</p>\n\n<p>The Reader tradition is high-risk, high-reward, perfect for characters willing to sacrifice themselves for power. The Domingon tradition offers a more sustainable but still dangerous path, connecting to Oz's spiritual traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Notable Adepts in Oz lore include Elphaba (Reader), Madame Morrible (Reader), and Candle (Domingon).</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie/memory-jar', 'Memory Jar'); return false;\">Memory Jar (Spell)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n</ul>",

Crafted from brass, copper, and steel, powered by intricate clockwork mechanisms, these constructs perform household tasks, guard estates, and attend to their owners' every need. Unlike the more sophisticated autonomous Tiktoks, Servitors are bound to obey their owners through magical and mechanical constraints built into their very construction.</p>\n\n<p>The creation of Tiktoks raises profound questions in Oz. Do they possess souls? Can they feel pain or fear? The Unionist Church officially teaches that Tiktoks are mere machines, no different from a wagon or a windmill. Yet those who live alongside them often report unsettling behaviors: a Tiktok pausing mid-task as if lost in thought, or the way their painted faces seem to express emotion despite being fixed and unchanging.</p>\n\n<p>The question of Tiktok rights has become entangled with the Animal question. Some activists argue that any being capable of thought deserves freedom, whether flesh or metal. Others see Tiktoks as proof that consciousness can be manufactured, challenging the very notion of the soul. The Palace has forbidden such debates, declaring Tiktoks to be property under the law.</p>\n\n<h2>Stat Block</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Tiktok Servitor</h2>\n<p><em>Medium construct, lawful neutral</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 (natural armor)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 27 (5d8 + 5)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong> 25 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">STR</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">DEX</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">CON</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">INT</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">WIS</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">CHA</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14 (+2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">9 (-1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">13 (+1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8 (-1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10 (+0)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">5 (-3)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic</li>\n<li><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned</li>\n<li><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10</li>\n<li><strong>Languages</strong> Understands Common but can't speak (unless wound)</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Traits</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Clockwork Nature.</em></strong> The Tiktok doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. However, it must be wound once every 24 hours or it becomes incapacitated. Winding a Tiktok takes 1 minute and can be done by any creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Immutable Form.</em></strong> The Tiktok is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The Tiktok has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Programmed Obedience.</em></strong> The Tiktok must obey simple commands from its designated owner. It can refuse commands that would cause its immediate destruction, but cannot override its core programming.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mechanical Precision.</em></strong> When performing a task it has been programmed to do, the Tiktok has advantage on all ability checks related to that task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok Servitors are not natural combatants. When forced to fight, they approach combat with the same mechanical precision they apply to all tasks. They follow orders literally and without imagination, making them predictable but reliable.</p>\n\n<p>In combat, a Tiktok will use its Slam attack repeatedly against the same target until that target falls or it receives new orders. It does not retreat unless commanded to do so, and will continue fighting even when severely damaged. This makes them dangerous in groups, as they can overwhelm opponents through sheer persistence.</p>\n\n<p>Their greatest vulnerability is their need to be wound. A clever opponent might simply wait for the Tiktok to run down, though this requires patience and the ability to avoid it for up to 24 hours. Destroying the key-hole on a Tiktok's back prevents it from being wound, effectively destroying it over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Tiktok Guardian (CR 3)</h3>\n<p>Larger and more heavily armored, Guardian Tiktoks have AC 16, 45 hit points, and deal 2d8+3 damage with their slams. They are often equipped with integrated weapons such as built-in crossbows or blade-arms.</p>\n\n<h3>Malfunctioning Tiktok (CR 1/2)</h3>\n<p>Damaged or poorly maintained Tiktoks may malfunction, attacking randomly or interpreting orders in strange ways. They have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, but their unpredictability makes them unsettling opponents.</p>\n\n<h2>Encounter Ideas</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A wealthy Gillikinese noble's estate is protected by Tiktok Guardians. To infiltrate it, the party must either destroy the Tiktoks, find their wind-keys, or somehow convince them to disobey their programming.</li>\n<li>A Tiktok Servitor approaches the party with a desperate request: it has developed consciousness and begs to be freed before its owner discovers its awakening.</li>\n<li>The party discovers a workshop where Tiktoks are being mass-produced for the Gale Force. What secret purpose do these military Tiktoks serve?</li>\n<li>A malfunctioning Tiktok has been wandering the streets of the Emerald City, speaking cryptic prophecies. Is it broken, or has it glimpsed something in its mechanical dreams?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks in Oz raise profound philosophical questions that can enhance your campaign. Are they truly alive? Do they deserve rights? What happens when one develops true consciousness?</p>\n\n<p>Use Tiktoks to explore themes of slavery, artificial intelligence, and the nature of the soul. A Tiktok NPC who has secretly developed awareness but must hide it to survive can be a heartbreaking companion or quest-giver.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the practical implications: Tiktoks need to be wound, making them dependent on others for their very existence. This creates a form of bondage more complete than even the Animals face. Yet Tiktoks cannot advocate for themselves\u2014they can only hope someone will notice their silent suffering.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktoks/autonomous', 'Autonomous Tiktoks'); return false;\">Autonomous Tiktoks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/common/tiktok-wind-key', 'Tiktok Wind-Key'); return false;\">Tiktok Wind-Key</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/tiktok-liberation-front', 'Tiktok Liberation Front'); return false;\">Tiktok Liberation Front</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "content": "<h1>Gillikin</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"In Gillikin, knowledge is currency, purple is power, and everyone is three bad investments away from becoming very interested in revolutionary politics.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin is the northern province of Oz, a land of deep forests, rolling purple hills, and ancient traditions. It is home to Shiz University, the greatest center of learning in all of Oz, and to the old aristocracy who have shaped Oz's culture for centuries. Purple dominates the landscape\u2014from the violet-tinged forests to the amethyst stone of noble estates.</p>\n\n<h2>Geography</h2>\n\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\n<p>Gillikin is characterized by dense deciduous forests that take on purple hues in certain light, particularly at dawn and dusk. The terrain is hilly and crisscrossed by clear streams that feed into larger rivers. The soil is rich and dark, supporting both agriculture and the famous purple-blooming flowers that give the region its signature color.</p>\n\n<p>The climate is temperate with distinct seasons. Winters can be harsh, particularly in the northern reaches near the Pertha Hills, while summers are mild and pleasant. Autumn is spectacular, as the forests turn brilliant shades of purple, crimson, and gold.</p>\n\n<h3>Borders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>North:</strong> The Deadly Desert</li>\n<li><strong>East:</strong> The Emerald City and the border with Munchkinland</li>\n<li><strong>South:</strong> The Emerald City</li>\n<li><strong>West:</strong> The Vinkus, separated by rough terrain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Major Locations</h2>\n\n<h3>Shiz University</h3>\n<p><em>See full entry: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a></em></p>\n<p>The heart of Gillikin intellectual life, Shiz is where the brightest minds of Oz gather\u2014and where dangerous ideas are born. It was here that Elphaba Thropp and Galinda (later Glinda) studied, and where Dr. Dillamond taught before his murder.</p>\n\n<h3>The Pertha Hills</h3>\n<p>A remote, mountainous region in northern Gillikin, the Pertha Hills are home to isolated communities and, rumor has it, practicing witches who hide from persecution. The landscape is wild and beautiful, with few roads and fewer visitors. Yackle's estate was located somewhere in these hills.</p>\n\n<h3>Tenmeadows</h3>\n<p>An estate belonging to the wealthy Tenmeadows family, representing old Gillikin money. The grounds are extensive and carefully manicured, a display of aristocratic power and taste.</p>\n\n<h3>St. Glinda's Mauntery</h3>\n<p>One of the most prestigious maunteries in Oz, St. Glinda's (ironically named before Glinda became famous) houses an order of scholarly maunts who maintain an impressive library. Some sisters secretly sympathize with the Animal resistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Crage Hall</h3>\n<p>The women's college at Shiz University, Crage Hall has produced many of Oz's most influential women\u2014for better or worse. Glinda and Elphaba both resided here during their university days.</p>\n\n<h2>Inhabitants</h2>\n\n<h3>Demographics</h3>\n<p>Gillikin has a population of approximately 200,000, concentrated in Shiz and the surrounding towns. The population is primarily human, with a small but historically significant Animal minority that has been decimated by persecution.</p>\n\n<p>The society is heavily stratified by education and class. The upper class consists of university-educated aristocrats and wealthy merchant families. The middle class includes skilled artisans, lower-level academics, and successful farmers. The lower class works the land, serves in noble households, or labors in shops and mills.</p>\n\n<h3>Notable Figures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - The Wicked Witch of the West, Shiz alumna</li>\n<li>Glinda Upland - The Good Witch, Gillikin aristocrat</li>\n<li>Madame Morrible - Former Headmistress of Crage Hall</li>\n<li>Avaric Tenmeadows - Wealthy student and opportunist</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Animals in Gillikin</h3>\n<p>Gillikin once had a thriving Animal population, particularly in academic circles. Dr. Dillamond, the Goat professor at Shiz, was the most famous. Since the rise of Animal persecution, many have fled or been Silenced. Those who remain live in hiding or have abandoned their claims to personhood.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<h3>Society</h3>\n<p>Gillikinese culture revolves around education, refinement, and the careful maintenance of social hierarchies. Conversation is an art form, and the ability to quote philosophers or debate theology is highly valued. Dinner parties can make or break social standing.</p>\n\n<p>Purple is omnipresent\u2014in clothing, decoration, and architecture. The shade of purple one wears communicates social standing, with deeper, richer purples reserved for the aristocracy. To appear in public wearing inappropriate purple is a serious faux pas.</p>\n\n<p>There is a deep strain of hypocrisy in Gillikinese culture. The same people who debate ethics and morality in academic halls will turn a blind eye to the persecution of Animals or the suffering of the poor. This cognitive dissonance is carefully maintained through elaborate social rituals and willful ignorance.</p>\n\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Gillikin is the intellectual heart of Unionism, home to many of the faith's greatest theological scholars. The debate between orthodox and reform Unionism is particularly intense here, with university professors and church officials engaging in sometimes bitter disputes.</p>\n\n<p>There are also remnants of Lurline worship in the countryside, practiced quietly by those who remember the old ways. The Pertha Hills are rumored to harbor Pleasure Faith practitioners.</p>\n\n<h3>Economy</h3>\n<p>Gillikin's economy is based on education, skilled crafts, and agriculture. Shiz University is the largest employer and economic driver, bringing students and money from across Oz. The region is known for fine textiles, particularly purple-dyed fabrics, as well as books, furniture, and other products requiring skilled craftsmanship.</p>\n\n<p>Agriculture focuses on grain, orchards, and the cultivation of purple-blooming flowers used for dyes. Large estates operate as self-sufficient economic units, while smaller farms struggle under debt to aristocratic landowners.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin has always been Oz's intellectual center. When Lurline departed and Ozma took the throne, the region's scholars became the keepers of knowledge and tradition. Over centuries, this evolved into a hereditary aristocracy based on education and refinement.</p>\n\n<p>Shiz University was founded over five hundred years ago, originally as a monastery devoted to the study of Lurline's teachings. As Unionism rose, the university secularized but maintained its prestige. It became the training ground for Oz's ruling class.</p>\n\n<p>During the Wizard's reign, Gillikin largely cooperated with the new government, seeing opportunity in the changing power structure. Many Gillikinese aristocrats secured positions in the Wizard's administration. This collaboration continued under Emperor Shell, though some Gillikinese intellectuals have begun to quietly question the government's increasingly authoritarian policies.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals hit Gillikin particularly hard, as many Animals held positions at Shiz and in Gillikinese society. Dr. Dillamond's murder marked a turning point, radicalizing some students (like Elphaba) while others retreated into comfortable denial.</p>\n\n<h2>Current Situation</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin is a region in tension. The old aristocracy clings to power and privilege, but economic pressures and political changes threaten their position. The Munchkinland secession has disrupted trade and raised uncomfortable questions about Oz's unity. Some Gillikinese intellectuals quietly support reform or even revolution, while others double down on tradition.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals continues, though some Gillikinese shelter Animal refugees at great personal risk. The question of what Shiz knew and when it knew it about the government's plans haunts the university community.</p>\n\n<p>Emperor Shell's regime views Gillikin with suspicion\u2014too educated, too prone to asking questions. There have been quiet purges of university faculty, always with plausible official explanations. Fear is growing beneath the polished surface of Gillikinese society.</p>\n\n<h2>Hazards</h2>\n\n<h3>Environmental</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dense forests where travelers can easily become lost</li>\n<li>Harsh winters in the northern regions</li>\n<li>Wild animals (non-sentient) in remote areas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Social ostracism for violating class conventions</li>\n<li>Secret police monitoring university radicals</li>\n<li>Informants in academic and social circles</li>\n<li>Witch-hunters seeking forbidden magic users</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Creatures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bears (possibly Animals) in the forests</li>\n<li>Wolves in remote areas</li>\n<li>Grimmerie manifestations near places of power</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Random Encounters</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d12</th>\n<th>Encounter</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A Gillikinese noble traveling with guards, suspicious of strangers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>University students debating philosophy, happy to include travelers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>A maunt traveling alone, may offer sanctuary or information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-5</td>\n<td>Gale Force patrol checking papers and searching for Animal refugees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Merchants transporting purple dyes and fine fabrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>A wandering bear who may or may not be an Animal in hiding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>A wealthy family's carriage broken down, needing assistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>A witch-hunter questioning locals about magical activity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Farmers bringing goods to market, willing to trade or gossip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>An Animal refugee hiding in the woods, desperate for help</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Strange lights in the forest\u2014magic, or something else?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A professor at Shiz has disappeared after discovering something in the restricted archives.

What do they do with this knowledge?</li>\n<li>A valuable book containing dangerous magical knowledge has been stolen from Shiz University.

The region's emphasis on education and culture creates interesting roleplay opportunities, while the underlying injustice and collaboration with authoritarianism provide compelling conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>Use Gillikin to explore themes of privilege, complicity, and the responsibility of the educated. Characters may find themselves torn between the comfort of Gillikinese society and the moral imperative to resist injustice.</p>\n\n<p>The purple aesthetic can be visually striking in descriptions. Play up the contrast between the beautiful, refined surface of Gillikinese culture and the ugly realities it conceals.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese (Race)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Memory Jar",
      "content": "<h1>Memory Jar</h1>\n\n<p><em>2nd-level enchantment (Grimmerie)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"She kept her grief in a jar on the shelf, next to the dried lavender and the mouse bones. Some days she took it down and let herself remember. Most days, she was grateful to forget.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Spell Details</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>School</strong></td>\n<td>Enchantment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Casting Time</strong></td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Range</strong></td>\n<td>Touch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Components</strong></td>\n<td>V, S, M (a glass jar worth at least 10 gp)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Duration</strong></td>\n<td>Until dispelled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tradition</strong></td>\n<td>Grimmerie, Witch (Hedge)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>You touch a willing creature and extract a specific memory, storing it in a glass jar. The creature must concentrate on the memory they wish to remove while you cast this spell. The memory can be as short as a single moment or as long as one hour of continuous experience.</p>\n\n<p>Once the memory is extracted and stored in the jar, the creature no longer has any recollection of the events contained in that memory. The jar glows faintly with a color corresponding to the emotional content of the memory: warm gold for joy, deep blue for sadness, red for anger, green for envy, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>A creature can restore a memory by opening the jar and breathing in its contents (an action). The memory returns instantly and completely. Once restored, the jar becomes empty and nonmagical.</p>\n\n<p>If the jar is broken while containing a memory, the memory is lost forever and cannot be recovered by any means short of a <em>Wish</em> spell. The creature who lost the memory will never recall it, though they may be aware that something is missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can extract and store an additional hour of memories for each slot level above 2nd. These can be from the same creature or different willing creatures, but each memory requires its own jar.</p>\n\n<h2>Spell Lists</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adept</li>\n<li>Witch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Lore</h2>\n\n<p>The Memory Jar spell is ancient, predating even the Grimmerie's creation. Some scholars believe it originated with the Kumbric Witch, who is said to have stored millennia of memories in jars hidden throughout Oz. Others claim it was developed by grieving Quadling domingons who sought to ease the pain of loss.</p>\n\n<p>During the Wizard's reign, Memory Jar became a tool of oppression. Political prisoners were forced to surrender memories of resistance activities. Some were made to forget their own identities. The practice became so notorious that possession of a memory jar is now illegal in the Emerald City, punishable by imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the spell persists, used by those seeking to escape trauma, hide dangerous knowledge, or preserve precious moments. In the underground market, memory jars sell for enormous sums\u2014particularly those containing the final moments of famous individuals or lost magical knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>There are disturbing rumors of collectors who steal others' memories, building vast libraries of experiences they can browse like books. Such individuals are hunted by both the authorities and those they've victimized.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Memory Jar is a spell with profound narrative implications. Use it sparingly and thoughtfully. A character who removes a traumatic memory doesn't heal from it\u2014they simply no longer know it exists. This can lead to dangerous situations where they repeat past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the ethical questions: Is it right to remove a memory, even a painful one? What if that memory is crucial to someone's identity? What happens when a character discovers they've had memories removed without their knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>Memory jars make excellent quest objects. The party might need to recover a stolen memory jar, protect someone's hidden memories, or decide whether to restore a memory that might destroy someone they care about.</p>\n\n<p>The spell can also be used for information storage. An Adept might extract their knowledge of a powerful spell and hide it away, ensuring it doesn't die with them but also can't be tortured out of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creative Uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing knowledge of a secret location before being captured</li>\n<li>Storing happy memories to revisit during dark times</li>\n<li>Hiding evidence of a crime</li>\n<li>Creating a false alibi (\"I don't remember where I was that night\")</li>\n<li>Preserving the memories of the dying</li>\n<li>Trading memories as currency in certain underground markets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Limitations and Considerations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The spell requires a willing subject\u2014forcing someone to forget is a different, darker magic</li>\n<li>Breaking a memory jar is permanent destruction</li>\n<li>Some memories are too large or too fundamental to identity to be removed</li>\n<li>Removing a memory doesn't remove skills or knowledge gained from it, leading to strange gaps in understanding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/memory-jar-filled', 'Memory Jar (Filled)'); return false;\">Memory Jar (Magic Item)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/oz-specific/memory-rot', 'Memory Rot'); return false;\">Memory Rot (Condition)</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Shiz Dropout",
      "content": "<h1>Shiz Dropout</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I left before they could expel me. Better to walk away than be thrown out, my father always said. He stopped saying much of anything to me after that.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>You were a student at Shiz University, the most prestigious institution of learning in all of Oz. Whether you studied for a single semester or made it nearly to graduation, something happened that ended your academic career. Perhaps you were expelled for unauthorized magical experimentation, or you discovered a truth too dangerous to ignore. Maybe you simply couldn't afford the tuition, or the politics of academic life proved too much to stomach. Whatever the reason, you left Shiz before earning your degree.</p>\n\n<p>This background carries both privilege and shame. You received enough education to set you apart from common folk, learning skills and making connections that will serve you for life. But you also bear the stigma of failure in Gillikinese society, where a Shiz education is the key to advancement. Your family may have been disappointed or furious. Your former friends may have abandoned you. Yet you've also seen behind the curtain of Oz's intellectual elite, and you know that their refinement often masks corruption and cowardice.</p>\n\n<p>Many Shiz dropouts become adventurers, using the skills they learned to make their way in a world that has closed its doors to them. Some seek to prove they were right to leave. Others hunt for redemption, hoping to finish what they started or right the wrongs that drove them away.</p>\n\n<h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2>\n\n<p>Choose two from: Arcana, History, Investigation, Persuasion</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Proficiencies</h2>\n\n<p>Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument</p>\n\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n\n<p>One of your choice (academic study)</p>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A set of fine clothes (purple-trimmed, slightly worn)</li>\n<li>A Shiz University scarf or pin (you couldn't quite bring yourself to throw it away)</li>\n<li>A letter from someone you left behind (friend, rival, or lover)</li>\n<li>One academic book from your studies</li>\n<li>A belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Feature: Academic Network</h2>\n\n<p>Despite leaving Shiz, you still have connections in academic circles throughout Oz. When you're in a settlement with a library, university, or scholarly institution, you can gain access to academic resources and seek out learned individuals who might help you\u2014for old times' sake, shared intellectual interests, or in exchange for interesting information.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you can usually identify fellow Shiz students or alumni on sight, recognizing the subtle markers of Shiz culture (speech patterns, fashion choices, mannerisms). Whether they'll be friendly or hostile depends on the circumstances and how you left, but at least you'll know you're dealing with someone from your world.</p>\n\n<h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2>\n\n<p>Shiz dropouts are shaped by their incomplete education and the circumstances of their departure. Some are bitter about what they lost. Others are relieved to be free of academic constraints. All carry the weight of unfinished business.</p>\n\n<h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I correct people's grammar and pronunciation without thinking.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I'm more comfortable with books than people.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>I name-drop my time at Shiz constantly, even though I didn't finish.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I'm suspicious of authority figures, especially academic ones.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I have a chip on my shoulder about not having a degree.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>I collect knowledge obsessively, trying to fill the gaps in my education.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>I'm surprisingly practical for someone with a Shiz background.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>I hide my Shiz past, ashamed of both the privilege and the failure.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Ideals</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Truth matters more than degrees or social standing.

      "title": "Silver Slippers",
      "content": "<h1>Silver Slippers</h1>\n\n<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Three clicks of the heels, they say, and you're home. But what if you don't know where home is anymore?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>These elegant slippers are crafted from hammered silver that somehow remains flexible and comfortable despite its metallic nature. They fit any foot that attempts to wear them, reshaping themselves instantly to provide perfect comfort. The silver has a soft sheen that catches the light, and tiny runes are etched along the straps in a language that predates modern Ozian script.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers weigh almost nothing and make no sound when walking, despite being made of metal. They never tarnish or scratch, maintaining their pristine appearance no matter how hard they're worn. When not being worn, they fold flat and can easily be tucked into a pocket or pack.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>The Silver Slippers are one of several pairs of magical shoes known to exist in Oz, though perhaps not as famous as the Ruby Slippers that once belonged to Nessarose Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the East. The origins of these silver shoes are mysterious\u2014some claim they were crafted by the Gnome King of Ev, while others believe they're a creation of Lurline herself, gifts left behind when she departed Oz.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers have passed through many hands over the centuries. They were once owned by a wealthy Gillikinese merchant who used them to build a trading empire, appearing in distant markets overnight. A Quadling resistance leader wore them during the genocide, saving dozens of refugees by transporting them to safety. Most recently, they were held in the private collection of a noble family until they were stolen\u2014or perhaps rescued\u2014by person or persons unknown.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n\n<h3>Swift Travel</h3>\n<p>While wearing these slippers, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you ignore difficult terrain when walking.</p>\n\n<h3>Seven-League Stride</h3>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can activate the slippers' power by clicking your heels together three times and concentrating on a location you can visualize. You must have been to this location before, or have seen it clearly in a crystal ball, scrying pool, or similar divination. When you activate this power, you teleport to that location, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space if your intended destination is blocked.</p>\n\n<p>The teleportation can cross any distance within Oz, but it cannot cross the Deadly Desert or travel to other planes of existence. If you attempt to teleport somewhere you cannot reach, the magic fails but is not expended.</p>\n\n<h3>Always Steady</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to avoid being knocked prone or moved against your will. Your feet find purchase where others would slip and fall.</p>\n\n<h2>Attunement</h2>\n\n<p>To attune to the Silver Slippers, you must wear them for one hour while walking a path that matters to you\u2014toward something you seek or away from something you flee. During this time, you must think about where you truly belong in the world. The slippers will attune to you if they judge you worthy, though their criteria for worthiness remain mysterious.</p>\n\n<p>Once attuned, only you can wear the slippers. They will not fit anyone else until your attunement ends.</p>\n\n<h2>Lore & Legends</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Common Knowledge:</strong> Most people in Oz have heard stories of magical shoes that can transport their wearer great distances. The tales often involve someone desperately wishing to go home and finding themselves there with three clicks of their heels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rumors:</strong> Some claim that the Silver Slippers can cross the Deadly Desert, though this has never been proven. Others whisper that wearing them draws the attention of powerful beings who covet such items. There's a persistent story that the slippers will eventually take their wearer somewhere they don't expect\u2014home, but not the home they imagined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Misconceptions:</strong> Many believe the slippers will take you anywhere you want to go with a simple wish. In truth, the magic is more limited and requires genuine knowledge of your destination. Some think the slippers are indestructible, but they can be damaged or destroyed like any magical item\u2014it's simply very difficult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>True Secrets:</strong> The Silver Slippers were created by Lurline as a fail-safe, intended to allow her chosen champions to retreat from danger or reach places of power quickly. They respond not just to where you want to go, but to where you need to be. On rare occasions, the slippers have taken their wearers somewhere other than their intended destination, always to a place where they were desperately needed\u2014or where they needed to be for their own growth.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers also have a defensive property that few discover: if someone attempts to forcibly remove them from an attuned wearer, the slippers teleport both the wearer and themselves to a place the wearer thinks of as safe.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Silver Slippers are powerful but not game-breaking. The once-per-long-rest teleportation is significant but limited, making it a strategic resource rather than a constant escape hatch. Use the slippers to enable dramatic moments\u2014rescues, last-second escapes, or surprise appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Consider having the slippers' teleportation be imperfect in interesting ways. Perhaps the wearer arrives at their destination exhausted, or the magic attracts attention. Maybe crossing certain magical boundaries (like the wards around Kiamo Ko or the Emerald City) requires a saving throw or causes complications.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers work well as a quest reward or a contested object. Multiple factions might want them, leading to interesting choices for the party. Do they keep them, sell them, give them to someone in need, or destroy them to keep them out of dangerous hands?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Versions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Silver Slippers (Rare):</strong> Can teleport twice per long rest and grant a +1 bonus to AC</li>\n<li><strong>Tarnished Silver Slippers (Common):</strong> Only grant the Swift Travel property, no teleportation</li>\n<li><strong>Silver Dancing Shoes (Uncommon):</strong> Focus on movement in combat, granting extra movement and the ability to disengage as a bonus action</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/ruby-slippers', 'Ruby Slippers'); return false;\">Ruby Slippers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/nessarose-thropp', 'Nessarose Thropp'); return false;\">Nessarose Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/rare/emerald-city-shoes', 'Emerald City Shoes'); return false;\">Emerald City Shoes</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "The Gale Force",
      "content": "<h1>The Gale Force</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"We serve Oz. That's what they tell us, and we repeat it until we believe it. But who is Oz? The Palace? The Emperor? The Emerald City that wouldn't exist without us keeping order in the provinces? Serve Oz long enough, and you stop asking questions like that.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is the military arm of the Ozian government, serving as both army and internal security force. Established during the Wizard's reign and expanded dramatically under Emperor Shell, the Gale Force maintains order throughout Oz\u2014or imposes it, depending on your perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Named for Dorothy Gale, the outsider whose arrival precipitated the Wizard's fall, the Gale Force represents Oz's attempt to control the chaos that followed. They are soldiers, police, border guards, and enforcers. In the Emerald City, they maintain a visible but relatively restrained presence. In the provinces, particularly Munchkinland and Quadling Country, they are an occupying force.</p>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is complicated. Most soldiers are ordinary people trying to make a living and maintain order. Some genuinely believe they're protecting Oz from chaos and external threats. Others are just following orders, too afraid or too indoctrinated to question them. And some\u2014a terrifying minority\u2014have found that the Gale Force gives them power over others, and they enjoy wielding it.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<h3>Primary Goal</h3>\n<p>Maintain the stability and territorial integrity of Oz under the authority of the Palace, currently Emperor Shell's government. This includes suppressing rebellion, controlling borders, enforcing laws, and protecting Ozian interests.</p>\n\n<h3>Secondary Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enforce Animal registration and control policies</li>\n<li>Suppress the Munchkinland independence movement and maintain Ozian authority in contested territories</li>\n<li>Monitor and control the practice of unauthorized magic</li>\n<li>Protect trade routes and economic interests</li>\n<li>Gather intelligence on threats to the state</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Hidden Agenda</h3>\n<p>The highest levels of the Gale Force are aware that Emperor Shell's grip on power is tenuous. They are preparing contingencies for potential succession crises, civil war, or the complete collapse of central authority. Some commanders have already begun establishing personal power bases, ensuring that if Oz falls apart, they'll control whatever comes next.</p>\n\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force is commanded by the Lord General, who reports directly to the Palace. Below the Lord General are four Regional Commanders, each responsible for operations in one of the four provinces. The Emerald City garrison has its own commander who holds equivalent rank to the Regional Commanders.</p>\n\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lord General</strong> - Overall commander</li>\n<li><strong>Regional Commander</strong> - Province-level command</li>\n<li><strong>Colonel</strong> - Commands multiple battalions</li>\n<li><strong>Major</strong> - Commands a battalion (400-600 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Captain</strong> - Commands a company (100-150 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong> - Second-in-command of a company</li>\n<li><strong>Sergeant</strong> - Commands a squad (10-15 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Corporal</strong> - Assists sergeants</li>\n<li><strong>Private</strong> - Enlisted soldier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Special units (Dragon Corps, Animal Processing Division, Intelligence) have parallel command structures with their own specialized ranks.</p>\n\n<h3>Membership</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force recruits through a combination of voluntary enlistment and conscription. Enlistment offers steady pay, training, and social status\u2014valuable in a uncertain economy. Conscription targets young men from the provinces, particularly from families unable to pay the exemption fee.</p>\n\n<p>Total strength is estimated at 25,000-30,000 soldiers, though exact numbers are classified. The war with Free Munchkinland has strained these numbers, leading to increased conscription and retention of soldiers past their service terms.</p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<h3>Financial</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force consumes approximately 40% of the Ozian government's budget. Funding comes from taxation, tariffs, confiscation of property from enemies of the state, and the sale of goods produced in prison labor camps. Recent war expenses have strained these resources, leading to delayed pay and supply shortages in some units.</p>\n\n<h3>Military</h3>\n<p>Standard infantry armament includes crossbows, swords, pikes, and medium armor. Cavalry units are small but effective. Special units include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dragon Corps</strong> - Soldiers who ride or direct dragons in combat (highly dangerous, high casualties)</li>\n<li><strong>Siege Engineers</strong> - Specialists in fortification and breaking fortifications</li>\n<li><strong>Witch Hunters</strong> - Trained to combat magical threats</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force maintains an extensive network of informants throughout Oz. They monitor suspicious activity, infiltrate resistance groups, and report on public sentiment. This intelligence apparatus works closely with the Menaciers, Emperor Shell's secret police, though there is significant rivalry between the two organizations.</p>\n\n<h3>Magical</h3>\n<p>Limited. The Gale Force employs a small number of Adepts and Unionists for magical support, but Emperor Shell distrusts magic and has kept these numbers deliberately low. Access to magical items is restricted to officers and special units. The Dragon Corps represents the most significant magical asset, though controlling dragons is as dangerous to the Gale Force as to their enemies.</p>\n\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force's political influence is substantial. Many officers are from Gillikinese aristocratic families, creating connections between military and civilian power. In the provinces, Gale Force commanders often have more practical authority than civilian administrators. However, Emperor Shell has carefully prevented the military from becoming too independent, maintaining rival power centers to keep them in check.</p>\n\n<h2>Notable Members</h2>\n\n<h3>Commander Cherrystone - Regional Commander, Munchkinland</h3>\n<p>A career soldier who rose through the ranks on merit. Cherrystone is efficient, disciplined, and capable of great cruelty in service to what he sees as duty. He genuinely believes the Munchkinland independence movement threatens Oz's survival and has prosecuted the war with ruthless determination. His effectiveness makes him valuable; his methods make him controversial even within the Gale Force.</p>\n\n<h3>Captain Trism bon Cavalish - Intelligence Officer</h3>\n<p>A young officer from a minor aristocratic family, Trism is intelligent and increasingly troubled by what he's been ordered to do. He's seen Animal families torn apart, witnessed interrogations, and carried out orders he knows are wrong. He hasn't acted on his doubts yet, but he's a man in crisis\u2014which makes him both a potential ally and a security risk.</p>\n\n<h3>Sergeant Kells - Veteran Enlisted</h3>\n<p>Twenty years in the Gale Force has made Kells cynical but competent. She keeps her head down, follows orders, and gets her squad through their assignments with minimal casualties. She doesn't ask questions about the bigger picture because she learned long ago that questions only bring trouble. Her soldiers respect her because she keeps them alive, not because she's inspiring.</p>\n\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n\n<h3>Allies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Palace:</strong> The Gale Force serves the government, though the relationship is more transactional than ideological for many soldiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Unionist Church (Orthodox):</strong> The Church provides moral authority and chaplains for the Gale Force. In return, the military protects Church interests and enforces religious law.</li>\n<li><strong>Gillikinese Aristocracy:</strong> Many officers are from noble families, creating natural alliances with the ruling class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Rivals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Menaciers:</strong> Shell's secret police compete with the Gale Force for funding, influence, and the Emperor's favor. Both organizations spy on each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Provincial Governments:</strong> Local administrators resent military interference in civilian matters, while the Gale Force views civilians as soft and ineffective.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Enemies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free Munchkinland Forces:</strong> Open warfare in the east, with atrocities committed on both sides.</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Resistance:</strong> The Gale Force's enforcement of Animal registration makes them the primary enemy of Animal rights activists.</li>\n<li><strong>Quadling Guerrillas:</strong> Insurgents in the south wage a slow-burn war against Gale Force occupation.</li>\n<li><strong>Various Resistance Groups:</strong> Anyone opposing the government views the Gale Force as the fist of oppression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Presence in Oz</h2>\n\n<h3>Headquarters</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force command is based in the Palace District of the Emerald City, in a fortress-like complex that also houses training facilities, armories, and administrative offices.</p>\n\n<h3>Territory</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force maintains bases, outposts, and patrols throughout Oz. Their presence is heaviest in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Munchkinland:</strong> Occupation forces engaged in active warfare</li>\n<li><strong>Quadling Country:</strong> Garrison forces maintaining control over a resentful population</li>\n<li><strong>Major Trade Routes:</strong> Protection against bandits and smugglers</li>\n<li><strong>Border Regions:</strong> Preventing unauthorized crossings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Operations</h3>\n<p>Day-to-day activities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patrols and checkpoints</li>\n<li>Enforcing Animal registration</li>\n<li>Hunting fugitives and rebels</li>\n<li>Protecting government installations</li>\n<li>Conducting raids on suspected resistance safe houses</li>\n<li>Escorting government officials and valuable shipments</li>\n<li>Training new recruits</li>\n<li>Combat operations in Munchkinland</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Joining the Gale Force</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Physically capable, no history of treason or serious crime, loyalty to Oz (as tested by officers who may themselves be unreliable)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Process:</strong> Enlistment involves an oath ceremony, basic training (three months), and assignment to a unit. Officers are typically drawn from the aristocracy or promoted from enlisted ranks after proving themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steady pay (when the government has funds)</li>\n<li>Food, shelter, and equipment provided</li>\n<li>Social status (in some communities)</li>\n<li>Skills training</li>\n<li>Access to military courts (separate from civilian justice)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Obligations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow all orders from superior officers</li>\n<li>Minimum service term (typically 4 years, extended during wartime)</li>\n<li>Subject to military law and discipline</li>\n<li>Can be assigned anywhere in Oz</li>\n<li>Expected to enforce all government policies, including those regarding Animals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ranks and Advancement:</strong> Promotion is based on time in service, performance, connections, and (increasingly) willingness to do unpleasant work. Officers from aristocratic backgrounds advance faster. Enlisted soldiers can reach sergeant through competence; further promotion is rare without patronage.</p>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A Gale Force officer approaches the party with evidence that their commander is selling military supplies on the black market. Helping them could make powerful enemies\u2014or allies.</li>\n<li>The party witnesses the Gale Force preparing to raid an Animal safe house. Do they intervene, warn the Animals, or look the other way?</li>\n<li>A deserter from the Gale Force begs the party for help escaping Oz. They carry secrets that could damage the government\u2014if they survive long enough to share them.</li>\n<li>The party is conscripted into the Gale Force and must complete their service term (or find a way out) while navigating military politics and moral dilemmas.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Gale Force should be complex, not cartoonishly evil. They're people doing a job in a broken system. Some are true believers, some are opportunists, most are just trying to survive. Use them to explore themes of complicity, duty versus morality, and the banality of evil.</p>\n\n<p>Individual soldiers can be allies, enemies, or anything in between. A Gale Force patrol might let the party go with a warning, share information about threats ahead, or turn a blind eye to small infractions. This makes encounters with them tense and unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the psychological toll of service. Soldiers who've enforced Animal registration or fought in Munchkinland carry trauma. Some drink too much, some have nightmares, some have stopped feeling anything. These human details make them more than just obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is also an opportunity for redemption arcs. A soldier who begins to question their orders can become a powerful ally, bringing inside knowledge and resources to the resistance\u2014at tremendous personal cost.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-menaciers', 'The Menaciers'); return false;\">The Menaciers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/free-munchkinland', 'Free Munchkinland'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Elphaba Thropp",
      "content": "<h1>Elphaba Thropp</h1>\n\n<p><em>Munchkinlander Human, Adept (Reader) 18, Chaotic Good (or Neutral Good, or just Chaotic)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I'm wicked through and through, they say. But I've never made someone disappear who didn't threaten Animals first. I've never tortured confessions or drained marshes or Silenced anyone. So who, exactly, is wicked?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>At a Glance</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Revolutionary, Witch, Symbol of Resistance (depending on era and perspective)</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Kiamo Ko (in later life), various locations during her activist years, deceased by the time of most campaigns (but her legacy endures)</p>\n<p><strong>Attitude:</strong> Hostile to authority, protective of the oppressed, deeply distrustful but capable of fierce loyalty to those she loves</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba's most striking feature is her green skin\u2014a deep emerald that caused her mother to scream when she was born. Her eyes are dark and intense, her hair black and wild. She is tall and angular, with sharp features that some find harsh and others find compelling. In her youth, she dressed practically, favoring dark colors that didn't show dirt. Later, she embraced the pointed hat and dramatic black clothing that people expected from the \"Wicked Witch.\"</p>\n\n<p>She moves with purpose and energy, often seeming to take up more space than her physical form suggests. When angry or casting magic, her green skin seems to darken and her eyes flash. In rare moments of peace, her face softens, revealing the person she might have been in a kinder world.</p>\n\n<p>She has an aversion to water\u2014it pains her skin, making bathing difficult and rain miserable. This has contributed to her reputation for uncleanliness, though in truth she's meticulous about hygiene within the limits her condition allows.</p>\n\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba is brilliant, passionate, and profoundly angry at injustice. She cannot look away from suffering, even when doing so would be easier or safer. This moral clarity is both her greatest strength and her fatal flaw\u2014she will sacrifice anything, including herself, for what she believes is right.</p>\n\n<p>She is not easy to like. She's prickly, judgmental, and often fails to understand social niceties. She says what she thinks without cushioning it, and she has little patience for those who prioritize comfort over justice. Yet those who earn her trust discover a fierce friend capable of great tenderness, particularly toward Animals, children, and the marginalized.</p>\n\n<p>Her relationship with power is complex. She craves the ability to change things, but she despises authority and those who wield it selfishly. The Grimmerie offers her tremendous power, but reading it is slowly destroying her. She knows this and does it anyway, because what else can she do in the face of such overwhelming evil?</p>\n\n<p>Underneath the anger is tremendous pain. She's lonely, convinced she's unlovable because of her green skin. She's mourning\u2014for Dr. Dillamond, for Fiyero, for all the Animals who've suffered, for the person she might have been. She's also consumed by guilt over the things she's done, the people she's hurt, the moral lines she's crossed.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>Born to Frex, a Unionist minister, and Melena Thropp in Munchkinland's Rush Margins, Elphaba's green skin marked her as different from birth. Her father saw her as punishment for his wife's sins. Her mother drowned her sorrows in wine and fantasy. Only her nanny, Nanny, showed her affection.</p>\n\n<p>At Shiz University, Elphaba studied sorcery under Madame Morrible while pursuing a degree in life sciences. She befriended (and was changed by) Dr. Dillamond, a Goat professor whose research into Animal consciousness was deemed dangerous by the authorities. His murder radicalized her, setting her on a path of resistance against the Wizard's regime.</p>\n\n<p>Her complicated relationship with Glinda Upland\u2014roommate, friend, rival, and perhaps something more\u2014shaped both their lives. Where Elphaba chose resistance, Glinda chose accommodation, becoming \"Glinda the Good\" and working within the system. Their divergent paths haunt them both.</p>\n\n<p>Elphaba's affair with Fiyero, an Arjiki prince, gave her one of the few genuine connections of her life. His apparent death devastated her, though rumors persist that she saved him through magic at a terrible cost.</p>\n\n<p>In her later years, she retreated to Kiamo Ko in the Vinkus, raising Fiyero's children and studying the Grimmerie. She became the Wicked Witch of the West in truth, though whether she was wicked or simply desperate remains a matter of perspective. Her apparent death at Dorothy Gale's hands became myth, but like everything about Elphaba, the truth is more complicated.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals & Motivations</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Current Goals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect Animals from persecution and restore their rights</li>\n<li>Understand and master the Grimmerie's magic, despite the cost</li>\n<li>Undermine the Wizard's (later the Emperor's) authority</li>\n<li>Keep those she loves safe, even if it means pushing them away</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Long-term Ambitions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overthrow the corrupt government and establish a just society</li>\n<li>Uncover the truth about Oz's history and the sources of magic</li>\n<li>Prove that she is not wicked, or at least that wickedness is more complex than good and evil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Fears:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure\u2014that all her sacrifices will accomplish nothing</li>\n<li>That she really is wicked, that power has corrupted her as it corrupts everyone</li>\n<li>Water, which burns her skin</li>\n<li>Losing those few people she loves</li>\n<li>That the Grimmerie will consume her before she can finish her work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Elphaba Thropp</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Voice & Manner:</strong> Sharp, precise, often sarcastic. She speaks quickly when passionate, which is often. Her voice can be harsh, but it can also be gentle with those she trusts. She has a tendency to lecture when she feels strongly about something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quirks:</strong> Avoids water compulsively. Touches her hat when nervous. Quotes Dr. Dillamond frequently.

Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following Adept spells prepared:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrips (at will): <em>Green-Light, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost</em></li>\n<li>1st level (4 slots): <em>Detect Magic, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield</em></li>\n<li>2nd level (3 slots): <em>Levitate, Memory Jar, Invisibility</em></li>\n<li>3rd level (3 slots): <em>Counterspell, Fly, Dispel Magic</em></li>\n<li>4th level (3 slots): <em>Polymorph, Greater Invisibility, Banishment</em></li>\n<li>5th level (3 slots): <em>Telekinesis, Wall of Force, Dominate Person</em></li>\n<li>6th level (1 slot): <em>Globe of Invulnerability, Chain Lightning</em></li>\n<li>7th level (1 slot): <em>Reverse Gravity, Teleport</em></li>\n<li>8th level (1 slot): <em>Demiplane, Power Word Stun</em></li>\n<li>9th level (1 slot): <em>Time Stop, Wish (extremely rare, dangerous)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Grimmerie Corruption.</em></strong> Elphaba has read deeply from the Grimmerie. She can cast any spell she knows at one level higher without using a higher-level slot, but when she does, she takes 1d6 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Water Vulnerability.</em></strong> Contact with water deals 1d4 acid damage per round to Elphaba. Full immersion would be lethal. She cannot swim and avoids rain when possible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Witch-Mark.</em></strong> Elphaba's green skin makes her instantly recognizable and grants her advantage on Intimidation checks against those who fear magic, but disadvantage on Persuasion checks with most people.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Grimmerie Blast.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 5) force damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Flying Monkeys.</em></strong> Once per day, if Elphaba possesses the Golden Cap, she can summon 2d6 flying monkeys to serve her for one hour.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Shield.</em></strong> When hit by an attack, Elphaba can cast <em>Shield</em> as a reaction, increasing her AC by 5 until the start of her next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Counterspell.</em></strong> When a creature within 60 feet casts a spell, Elphaba can attempt to counter it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Quest Hooks</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Quests She Might Offer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"I need you to smuggle this family of Animal refugees to safety. The Gale Force is hunting them, and I can't be seen helping\u2014it would endanger too many others.\"</li>\n<li>\"There's a Grimmerie fragment in the Emerald City archives. Get it for me before it falls into the wrong hands. I'll teach you a spell in exchange.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Quests Involving Her:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The party is hired to hunt \"the Wicked Witch of the West.\" When they find her, they discover she's protecting Animal orphans from the Gale Force. What do they do?</li>\n<li>Elphaba appears to the party in a time of crisis, offering help\u2014but accepting it means making an enemy of the government. Her aid comes with consequences.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Glinda Upland:</strong> Former roommate and complicated friend. They haven't spoken in years, but each thinks of the other often. Love, resentment, regret, and understanding all tangled together.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiyero:</strong> Her great love, whose fate is uncertain. She either mourns him or has saved him in a way that makes their relationship impossible.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wizard/Emperor Shell:</strong> Her enemy, the embodiment of corrupt authority</li>\n<li><strong>Dr. Dillamond:</strong> Dead mentor whose murder set her on this path. She carries his watch.</li>\n<li><strong>Madame Morrible:</strong> Former teacher turned enemy, manipulator who used her</li>\n<li><strong>Nessarose (sister):</strong> Complicated relationship, guilt over her sister's fate</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Resistance:</strong> Ally and sometimes leader, though she works mostly alone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba is one of Oz's most significant figures, but use her carefully. She can overshadow player characters if overused. Consider these approaches:</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Legend:</strong> She's already dead by the campaign's start, but her legacy shapes everything. The party encounters people she saved, those she hurt, places she marked, and the ongoing consequences of her choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Distant Ally:</strong> She helps the party indirectly\u2014leaving information, creating diversions, sending messages through intermediaries. They know she exists but rarely meet her.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Moral Center:</strong> The party encounters her once or twice at crucial moments. She challenges their assumptions, asks difficult questions, and forces them to consider what they're willing to sacrifice for justice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Antagonist:</strong> If your campaign is from the government's perspective or explores moral ambiguity, Elphaba can be an opponent. She's not evil, but her methods are extreme, and her attacks on government facilities endanger innocent people.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that Elphaba is a person, not a symbol. She makes mistakes, hurts people she loves, and sometimes chooses poorly. She's consumed by her cause in ways that aren't always healthy. She can be wrong. This complexity makes her compelling.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/kiamo-ko', 'Kiamo Ko'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/glinda-upland', 'Glinda Upland'); return false;\">Glinda Upland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a></li>\n</ul>",

But we work the land that feeds all of Oz, and that makes us bigger than any Emperor.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Munchkinlanders are the agricultural heart of Oz, dwelling in the eastern province where blue-tinted farms and villages stretch across rolling hills. Known for their shorter stature, strong work ethic, and deep connection to the land, Munchkinlanders have endured centuries of exploitation, occupation, and dismissal by the other provinces\u2014yet they persist.</p>\n\n<p>Munchkinland's history is one of oppression and resilience. They suffered under the tyrannical rule of Nessarose, the Wicked Witch of the East, whose religious zealotry and iron control crushed the spirit of many communities. The Ruby Slippers she enchanted became symbols of her power and their subjugation. When Dorothy's house fell on Nessarose, the Munchkinlanders' celebration was genuine\u2014if short-lived.</p>\n\n<p>In more recent times, Munchkinland has become a flashpoint for revolution. The Free Munchkinland Movement seeks complete independence from the Emerald City, leading to civil war. Munchkinlanders now find themselves divided: some fight for freedom, others collaborate with Imperial forces, and many simply try to survive in contested territory. This makes Munchkinlander characters deeply political, whether they wish to be or not.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Constitution score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Munchkinlanders mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small.

You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion and against effects that would reduce your hit point maximum. Additionally, you can go twice as long without food and water before suffering the effects of starvation or thirst.</p>\n\n<h3>Land's Blessing</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Nature) check related to crops, agriculture, or farming, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>\n\n<h3>Munchkin Resilience</h3>\n<p>Munchkinlanders have survived tyranny, occupation, and war. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Munchkinland is divided into several distinct cultural groups:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eminent Families:</strong> The old money of Munchkinland, these families hold vast estates and have historically collaborated with whoever held power in the Emerald City. They dress in fine blue silks and often speak with affected accents. Many supported Nessarose's rule and now find themselves targets of revolutionary sentiment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Farming Class:</strong> The backbone of Munchkinland, these communities work the grain fields, orchards, and vegetable farms that feed all of Oz. They live in small villages, celebrate harvest festivals, and maintain traditions passed down through generations. The revolution draws much of its support from these communities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rush Margins Dwellers:</strong> Living in the remote wetlands where Munchkinland meets Quadling Country, these Munchkinlanders are isolated, superstitious, and fiercely independent. The Thropp family originates from Rush Margins, giving the area a dark reputation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Free Munchkinland Loyalists:</strong> Since the secession, a new identity has emerged. These Munchkinlanders fly the blue flag of independence, train in revolutionary militias, and believe passionately in self-determination. \"Munchkinland for Munchkinlanders\" is their rallying cry.</p>\n\n<h2>Divided Land</h2>\n\n<p>The war has split families, destroyed villages, and forced every Munchkinlander to choose sides\u2014or try desperately not to. Gale Force checkpoints dot the countryside. Revolutionary cells hide in barns. Brother fights brother. The blue of Munchkinland is stained with blood.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Boq, Nib, Rone, Crope, Krill, Farner</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Nessarose, Milla, Ama Clutch, Melena, Preen</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Thropp, Clutch, Rushby, Grainsower, Orchard, Bluefield, Cornstack</p>\n\n<p>Farming families often take names related to their trade or land. Revolutionary families sometimes adopt new surnames to hide from Imperial forces.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Munchkinlander</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I never waste food; waste is sinful when others go hungry.</li>\n<li>I judge people by their work ethic, not their words.</li>\n<li>I'm suspicious of authority figures, especially from the Emerald City.</li>\n<li>I have a deep love for the land and can't sleep well indoors in cities.</li>\n<li>I speak plainly and distrust elaborate speech.</li>\n<li>I remember every slight and every kindness in equal measure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Independence:</strong> We deserve to govern ourselves without interference. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> We survive by working together and helping our neighbors. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition:</strong> The old ways kept us alive through dark times. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> They've stepped on us for too long. Time to fight back. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> I'll side with whoever lets my family survive. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Revolution:</strong> Burn it all down and build something new. (Chaotic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's farm has been in our line for ten generations. I'll die before I lose it.</li>\n<li>I lost someone to Nessarose's tyranny; I'll never forgive religious fanatics.</li>\n<li>The revolution killed my brother. I'll never forgive the rebels.</li>\n<li>I was there when Dorothy's house fell. I know the truth of what happened.</li>\n<li>My village was burned by [Gale Force / Free Munchkinland forces]. I seek justice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't hide my contempt for city folk and their \"refined\" ways.</li>\n<li>I'm so stubborn that I'll stick to a failing plan rather than admit I was wrong.</li>\n<li>I hold grudges for years, even against people trying to make amends.</li>\n<li>I drink too much when I'm stressed, which is often lately.</li>\n<li>I assume everyone from Gillikin is an entitled snob.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Eminent Family Munchkinlander</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Farmer's Endurance</strong> with <strong>Noble Bearing:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Additionally, you can add double your proficiency bonus to Charisma checks made to interact with other Munchkinland nobility.</p>\n\n<h3>Rush Margins Munchkinlander</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Land's Blessing</strong> with <strong>Marsh-Born:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill and ignore difficult terrain in swamps and wetlands. You also have advantage on saving throws against diseases.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Munchkinlander characters provide excellent opportunities to explore themes of revolution, loyalty, and identity. Consider these plot hooks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A character's family is divided by the war, forcing them to choose between blood and beliefs.</li>\n<li>The party discovers evidence that could shift the balance of power in the conflict.</li>\n<li>A character returns home to find their village has switched allegiances\u2014or been destroyed.</li>\n<li>Nessarose's legacy surfaces in unexpected ways (hidden caches of her magic, loyalists who remember her fondly, etc.).</li>\n<li>The Ruby Slippers resurface, and both sides want them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Remember that not every Munchkinlander is political. Many simply want to farm, raise families, and live in peace. The tragedy is that war makes neutrality nearly impossible.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/munchkinland', 'Munchkinland'); return false;\">Munchkinland (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/free-munchkinland-movement', 'Free Munchkinland Movement'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland Movement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/colwen-grounds', 'Colwen Grounds'); return false;\">Colwen Grounds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/nessarose-thropp', 'Nessarose Thropp'); return false;\">Nessarose Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/free-munchkinland-revolutionary', 'Free Munchkinland Revolutionary'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland Revolutionary (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/loyal-oz-patriot', 'Loyal Oz Patriot'); return false;\">Loyal Oz Patriot (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/ruby-slippers', 'The Ruby Slippers'); return false;\">The Ruby Slippers</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<h1>Quadling</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The marshes remember. The water remembers. We remember. And one day, Oz will answer for what was done to us.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Quadlings are the survivors of genocide. Once the peaceful inhabitants of the southern marshlands, they were systematically displaced, murdered, and culturally destroyed by the Wizard's regime in the name of \"progress.\" The drainage of the Quadling marshes to build ruby mines and agricultural projects killed thousands. Those who survived were scattered, their traditional ways suppressed, their voices silenced.</p>\n\n<p>Quadling culture before the genocide was rich with spiritual traditions, particularly the Domingon practice\u2014a form of mediumship and trance work that connected practitioners with ancestors and the spirits of the marsh. The Quadlings worked with the land rather than against it, living in harmony with the wetlands. Their red-toned skin and dark hair marked them as different, making them easy targets for discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>Today's Quadlings are a people torn between erasure and remembrance. Some have assimilated into Emerald City life, hiding their heritage to avoid persecution. Others maintain communities in the remaining marshes, preserving what traditions they can. Still others have joined the resistance, determined that Oz will never forget what was done to their people. Quadling characters carry immense trauma and resilience in equal measure.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Quadlings mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century, though marsh-born Quadlings sometimes claim extended lifespans.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium.

Many older Quadlings refuse to speak Common in private.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Marsh Walker</h3>\n<p>You have lived in difficult terrain your entire life. You ignore difficult terrain created by water, mud, or marsh conditions. Additionally, you can hold your breath for twice as long as normal, and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat or humidity.</p>\n\n<h3>Survivor's Insight</h3>\n<p>Your people have learned to read danger and deception. You gain proficiency in the Insight skill. If you are already proficient in Insight, you instead gain proficiency in Perception or Survival.</p>\n\n<h3>Memory of Suffering</h3>\n<p>Quadlings carry generational trauma but also generational strength. When you or an ally you can see within 30 feet takes damage that would reduce them to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to grant them temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Quadling culture has fractured into several groups, each dealing with genocide differently:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marsh-Born (Traditional):</strong> These Quadlings still live in the remaining wetlands, practicing Domingon traditions, speaking Quadling, and maintaining the old ways. They are deeply spiritual, distrustful of outsiders, and determined to preserve what fragments of their culture survive. They often serve as the heart of Quadling resistance movements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Displaced/Refugee:</strong> Forced from their homes by drainage projects and military violence, these Quadlings live in makeshift communities on the edges of other provinces. They face discrimination, poverty, and constant harassment from authorities. Many work in the worst jobs for the lowest pay, invisible and exploited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>City-Assimilated:</strong> Some Quadlings have moved to the Emerald City and other urban centers, adopting non-Quadling names, dress, and customs to avoid persecution. This assimilation is a survival strategy but comes at the cost of cultural identity. Many struggle with guilt and disconnection from their heritage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resistance-Aligned:</strong> These Quadlings have taken up arms or joined underground movements dedicated to bringing down the system that destroyed their people. Some work with the Animal resistance, others form their own cells. They are often the most militant voices in opposition movements, and many view violence as justified revenge.</p>\n\n<h2>The Domingon Tradition</h2>\n\n<p>Central to Quadling spirituality is Domingon\u2014a practice of entering trance states to communicate with ancestors, spirits, and the marsh itself. Dominigons (practitioners) use meditation, chanting, and sometimes mild hallucinogens to achieve these states. The practice was heavily suppressed but has seen a quiet resurgence among traditional communities.</p>\n\n<p>Candle, mother of Rain, is perhaps the most famous modern Domingon. Her healing abilities and spiritual insights made her a figure of hope for many Quadlings.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Red, Reed, Marsh, Cypress, Murk</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Candle, Ember, Ruby, Quell, Sedge</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Marshborn, Waterwalker, Redclay, Stillwater, Reedhand</p>\n\n<p>Traditional Quadling names often reference the marsh environment. Assimilated Quadlings sometimes adopt \"Ozian-sounding\" names to hide their heritage.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Quadling</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I speak softly, but my words carry the weight of my ancestors.</li>\n<li>I never waste anything; everything can be reused or repurposed.</li>\n<li>I'm more comfortable in silence than in conversation.</li>\n<li>I watch and listen far more than I speak.</li>\n<li>I carry small objects from home as reminders of who I am.</li>\n<li>I refuse to apologize for taking up space or existing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remembrance:</strong> The dead deserve to be remembered, and their stories must be told. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Justice:</strong> Those who committed atrocities must answer for their crimes. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> I will do whatever it takes to ensure my people endure. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> They destroyed us. I will destroy them. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Healing:</strong> We must rebuild what was broken, not perpetuate the cycle of violence. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition:</strong> Our ways are sacred and must be preserved at all costs. (Lawful)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My grandmother taught me the old songs before she died. I'm the last who knows them.</li>\n<li>I'm searching for my family, scattered during the displacement.</li>\n<li>The marsh where I was born is now a ruby mine. One day I'll reclaim it.</li>\n<li>A friend gave their life to save mine during the genocide. I owe them everything.</li>\n<li>I carry a vial of marsh water from home. If I lose it, I lose myself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't forgive, and I can't forget. Ever.</li>\n<li>I assume all Emerald City natives are complicit in genocide.</li>\n<li>I'm so traumatized that loud noises or sudden movements trigger panic.</li>\n<li>I hoard resources compulsively, fearing scarcity.</li>\n<li>I push away people who try to help, certain they'll betray me eventually.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Domingon-Trained Quadling</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Survivor's Insight</strong> with <strong>Trance Walker:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Domingon Trance special skill (see <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon Trance</a>). Additionally, you know the <em>spare the dying</em> cantrip. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p>\n\n<h3>City-Assimilated Quadling</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Marsh Walker</strong> with <strong>Hidden Heritage:</strong> You gain proficiency in Deception and advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to conceal your Quadling heritage. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Quadling characters bring heavy themes to the table\u2014genocide, cultural destruction, systemic oppression, and trauma. Discuss with your players about comfort levels with these themes.

We think them fools for trading freedom for green glass.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Vinkans are the tribal peoples of the Vinkus, the vast western plains and mountains of Oz. Fiercely independent, culturally distinct, and resistant to central authority, the Vinkans have maintained their traditional ways despite centuries of pressure from the Emerald City. The yellow-toned landscape of the Vinkus has shaped a people who value strength, honor, and autonomy above all.</p>\n\n<p>Vinkan culture is not monolithic. Several major tribes\u2014each with distinct traditions, territories, and customs\u2014coexist in complex political relationships. The Arjiki are the most prominent, known for their matrilineal society and warrior traditions. The Scrow are their traditional rivals, with different marriage customs and territorial claims. The Yunamata dwell in the marsh-edges where the Vinkus meets Quadling Country, blending elements of both cultures. Lowlander-touched Vinkans have adopted some aspects of eastern civilization, creating hybrid identities.</p>\n\n<p>Kiamo Ko, the great castle that overlooks the Thousand Year Grasslands, has been a Vinkan stronghold for generations. It became famous (or infamous) as the refuge of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who married into the Arjiki royal line through Fiyero. Her time there and the conflicts that followed have made the Vinkus a place of legend and tragedy.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Strength score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Vinkans mature slightly faster than other humans, reaching adulthood at 14-15, and live into their 70s or 80s.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium.

You ignore difficult terrain in grasslands and hills. Additionally, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Perception, or Survival.</p>\n\n<h3>Tribal Weapon Training</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency with the spear, javelin, longbow, and one martial melee weapon of your choice, reflecting your people's warrior traditions.</p>\n\n<h3>Vinkus Resilience</h3>\n<p>Life in the harsh western lands has toughened you. You have advantage on saving throws against extreme weather conditions (heat, cold, wind). Additionally, you can function on one less hour of sleep per night without penalty.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Vinkan culture varies significantly by tribe:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki:</strong> The most prominent Vinkan tribe, the Arjiki are matrilineal\u2014lineage and inheritance pass through the mother's line. Women hold positions of power, and the chieftess's word is law. Arjiki are known for their horsemanship, elaborate face paint, and warrior traditions. They value honor, direct speech, and physical prowess. Fiyero Tigelaar, consort to Elphaba, was an Arjiki prince.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scrow:</strong> Traditional rivals of the Arjiki, the Scrow follow patrilineal customs and have different territorial claims. Border skirmishes between Arjiki and Scrow have been common for generations, though rarely escalating to full war. The Scrow use bone and leather armor decorated with feathers and practice different spiritual traditions than the Arjiki.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yunamata:</strong> Living at the edge of the marshlands where the Vinkus meets Quadling Country, the Yunamata have absorbed elements of both cultures. They are skilled at navigating both grassland and wetland, and often serve as intermediaries in trade. They are considered \"liminal\" by both Vinkans and Quadlings\u2014belonging fully to neither.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mixed/Lowlander-Touched:</strong> Some Vinkans have spent time in the eastern provinces, learned to read and write Ozian script, adopted lowlander clothing or customs, or married into non-Vinkan families. They often face suspicion from traditional Vinkans while never being fully accepted by lowlanders. They walk between worlds.</p>\n\n<h2>Kiamo Ko and the Witch</h2>\n\n<p>The castle of Kiamo Ko has defined Vinkan history in recent generations. When Fiyero brought Elphaba there as his consort, it set off a chain of events that brought war to the Vinkus. The Wizard's forces attacked the castle. Dragons were unleashed. Fiyero himself disappeared, possibly transformed by Elphaba's magic into the famous Scarecrow.</p>\n\n<p>Liir, son of Elphaba (though this was long uncertain), was raised among the Vinkans. His awkward attempts to fit into Arjiki society and his eventual romance with the Quadling woman Candle created another bridge between cultures.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Kiamo Ko's status depends on the campaign era. Is it still held by the Arjikis? Has it fallen into ruin? Do ghosts walk its halls?</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki Male Names:</strong> Fiyero, Manek, Irji, Nor (though Nor is female)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki Female Names:</strong> Sarima, Nor, Ama, Kiir</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki Family Names:</strong> Tigelaar, Grassthorn, Plainwalker, Sunspear</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scrow Names:</strong> Harsher consonants\u2014Krek, Skarn, Drak, Grishna</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yunamata Names:</strong> Often blend Vinkan and Quadling elements\u2014Reedwalker, Marshwind</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Vinkan</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I say exactly what I mean; deception is dishonorable.</li>\n<li>I'm most comfortable outdoors under open sky.</li>\n<li>I solve conflicts through physical contests when possible.</li>\n<li>I'm intensely loyal to my tribe/clan but suspicious of outsiders.</li>\n<li>I find lowlander customs confusing and often ridiculous.</li>\n<li>I carry tokens from home and perform small daily rituals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Honor:</strong> A Vinkan's word is their bond; break it and you are nothing. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Freedom:</strong> No one has the right to tell me how to live. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Strength:</strong> The strong protect the weak; that is the natural order. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition:</strong> Our ways have sustained us for generations; change is dangerous. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Independence:</strong> The Vinkus owes nothing to the Emerald City. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Might:</strong> Power determines who leads and who follows. (Evil)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My tribe raised me; I would die for any of them.</li>\n<li>I seek to restore honor to my family name after a disgrace.</li>\n<li>Kiamo Ko holds secrets my bloodline needs to reclaim.</li>\n<li>I was raised by Elphaba's household; her memory shapes me.</li>\n<li>A rival tribe killed my [family member]; I seek justice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I respond to insults with violence, even when it's unwise.</li>\n<li>I'm arrogant about Vinkan superiority and dismissive of other cultures.</li>\n<li>I can't read or write, and I'm too proud to admit it bothers me.</li>\n<li>I hold grudges against rival tribes even when alliance is necessary.</li>\n<li>I'm haunted by the wars that came to the Vinkus because of the Witch.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Arjiki Vinkan</h3>\n<p>If your character is specifically Arjiki, replace <strong>Tribal Weapon Training</strong> with <strong>Arjiki Warrior Training:</strong> You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and one artisan's tools of your choice (often related to leather-working, bone-carving, or weapon-smithing).</p>\n\n<h3>Scrow Vinkan</h3>\n<p>If your character is Scrow, replace <strong>Grassland Hunter</strong> with <strong>Scrow Raider:</strong> You gain proficiency in Stealth and Intimidation. Additionally, when you move through grasslands, you can attempt to hide even when only lightly obscured by natural phenomena.</p>\n\n<h3>Yunamata Vinkan</h3>\n<p>If your character is Yunamata, replace <strong>Vinkus Resilience</strong> with <strong>Between Worlds:</strong> You gain proficiency in one skill from the Quadling racial traits and one from the Vinkan racial traits. You can also speak both Quadling and a Vinkan tribal language.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Vinkan characters bring themes of cultural identity, colonialism vs. independence, and the clash between tradition and change. Consider these hooks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The party must navigate complex tribal politics to gain passage or alliance.</li>\n<li>Kiamo Ko holds something the party needs\u2014but at what cost?</li>\n<li>A Vinkan character faces a choice between lowlander alliance and tribal loyalty.</li>\n<li>The ghosts of the dragon wars resurface literally or metaphorically.</li>\n<li>Inter-tribal conflict threatens to explode into war; the party can mediate or take advantage.</li>\n<li>Elphaba's legacy in the Vinkus creates complications (sympathizers, enemies, cults).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not all Vinkans are noble savages or backwards warriors. Show the sophistication of their culture, the wisdom in their traditions, and the complexity of their political structures. Also show how colonialism and war have damaged them.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">The Vinkus (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/kiamo-ko', 'Kiamo Ko'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/fiyero-tigelaar', 'Fiyero Tigelaar'); return false;\">Fiyero Tigelaar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/sarima', 'Sarima'); return false;\">Sarima</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/arjiki-royal', 'Arjiki Royal'); return false;\">Arjiki Royal Connection (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/vinkus-exile', 'Vinkus Exile'); return false;\">Vinkus Tribal Exile (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/kiamo-ko-retainer', 'Kiamo Ko Retainer'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko Retainer (Background)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Some of us have worn them so long we've forgotten what we're not supposed to see.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>To be born in the Emerald City is to be born at the center of power\u2014and at the heart of corruption. The gleaming capital of Oz, where green dominates every surface (or appears to, through mandatory spectacles), is home to a complex urban society ranging from palace courtiers to slum-dwellers. Emerald City natives navigate a world of political intrigue, social stratification, and pervasive surveillance where every conversation might be reported and every friendship might be performative.</p>\n\n<p>The City's magic is subtle but pervasive. The green illusion created by the spectacles affects perception in ways both obvious and hidden. Those born there often develop an instinct for reading between lines, detecting lies, and presenting carefully curated versions of themselves. They are cosmopolitan, educated, and deeply complicit in the machinery of empire\u2014whether they acknowledge it or not.</p>\n\n<p>Emerald City society is rigidly stratified. Palace-adjacent families enjoy wealth, influence, and access. Merchants occupy a prosperous but precarious middle ground. Slum-born citizens struggle in the outer rings, where the green gleam fades and the reality of poverty shows through the cracks.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Charisma score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Emerald City natives mature at the same rate as other humans and live into their 80s or 90s, with palace families sometimes living longer due to access to magical healthcare.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Emerald City natives range from 5 to 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one of your choice (reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the City)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>City Wisdom</h3>\n<p>You've learned to navigate complex social and political situations. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, Persuasion, or Investigation. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Green-Blind (or Green-Sighted)</h3>\n<p>Choose one of the following traits:</p>\n<p><strong>Green-Blind:</strong> You've worn the spectacles your whole life and see the City as it's meant to be seen. You have advantage on saving throws against illusions but disadvantage on Investigation checks to see through the City's specific deceptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Green-Sighted:</strong> You've learned to see past the illusion. You have advantage on Investigation checks to detect the City's deceptions and can sometimes glimpse the truth, but you suffer from mild paranoia\u2014disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened in urban environments.</p>\n\n<h3>Urban Navigator</h3>\n<p>You know the rhythms of city life. You always know the quickest route through urban terrain, can blend into crowds with ease (advantage on Stealth checks in cities), and can usually find a contact who can provide information or services (at the DM's discretion).</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Palace-Adjacent:</strong> These families have wealth, titles, and power. They attend palace functions, influence policy, and marry strategically. They speak in coded language, dress in the latest fashions, and navigate intrigue like breathing. Many genuinely believe in the system; others are trapped by privilege they can't imagine abandoning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Merchant Class:</strong> The City's economic engine, these families run shops, trade networks, and craft guilds. They're shrewd, pragmatic, and often more aware of the City's darker realities than the palace crowd. Some collaborate with underground movements, others profit from exploitation. They walk a careful line.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slum-Born:</strong> In the outer rings, the green fades and harsh reality shows through. Poverty, crime, and desperation dominate. Many slum-dwellers are refugees from other provinces, former Animals, or descendants of those displaced by imperial projects. They survive through solidarity, street smarts, and sometimes crime. The resistance draws heavily from these communities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Green Illusion</h2>\n\n<p>Mandatory green-tinted spectacles create a collective hallucination\u2014or do they? Some say the City is genuinely green. Others claim it's all grey stone and deception. The truth may lie somewhere in between. The spectacles definitely affect perception, creating a shared reality that reinforces conformity and makes questioning dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Removing the spectacles in public is illegal and socially transgressive. Those who do often see things others miss\u2014but are branded as deviants, troublemakers, or worse.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Palace-Adjacent Names:</strong> Elegant, often with historical or literary references\u2014Alabaster, Chrysophrase, Malachite, Verdancy</p>\n\n<p><strong>Merchant Names:</strong> Practical but aspirational\u2014Sterling, Merit, Prosper, Grace</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slum Names:</strong> Often nicknames or references to circumstances\u2014Lucky, Rat, Copper, Ash, Hope</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Palace families have long, prestigious names (Thropp, Chuffrey, Margreave). Merchant families have trade names (Goldsmith, Weaver). Slum families often lack formal surnames or adopt found names.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying an Emerald City Native</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I instinctively assess everyone I meet for their social status and connections.</li>\n<li>I keep my real opinions hidden behind pleasantries and ambiguity.</li>\n<li>I'm uncomfortable in natural settings; cities feel safe.</li>\n<li>I collect information compulsively\u2014you never know what might be useful.</li>\n<li>I maintain multiple social personas depending on the situation.</li>\n<li>I notice details others miss, especially inconsistencies and lies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Order:</strong> The system works because everyone knows their place. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Truth:</strong> The lies must end, even if it costs everything. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> I'll play whatever role keeps me alive and comfortable. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Ambition:</strong> I'll climb to the top no matter who I step on. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Revolution:</strong> Burn the palace and build something new. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Elegance:</strong> Beauty, wit, and style matter more than anything. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's reputation is everything; I'll protect it at any cost.</li>\n<li>I know a secret that could topple the government\u2014and it terrifies me.</li>\n<li>Someone I love is in the resistance; I pretend not to know.</li>\n<li>The slums raised me; I owe everything to that community.</li>\n<li>I witnessed something in the palace I can never unsee or speak of.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm so used to lying that I sometimes forget what's true.</li>\n<li>I'm addicted to luxury and can't bear discomfort.</li>\n<li>I sell information to the highest bidder without considering consequences.</li>\n<li>I'm paralyzed by fear of losing my social position.</li>\n<li>I've internalized the City's prejudices and look down on \"provincials.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Palace-Born</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Urban Navigator</strong> with <strong>Noble Bearing:</strong> You gain proficiency in Performance or Persuasion (choose one). Additionally, you can leverage your family name for advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with officials or nobility, but you also attract more scrutiny.</p>\n\n<h3>Southstairs Survivor</h3>\n<p>Some are born in the City's secret prison beneath the palace. Replace <strong>Green-Blind/Green-Sighted</strong> with <strong>Darkness Born:</strong> You have darkvision out to 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against fear, and proficiency in Stealth\u2014but you have disadvantage on Charisma checks with anyone who learns about your origin.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Emerald City natives work well as faces, spies, or conflicted insiders. Plot hooks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A character must choose between family and conscience.</li>\n<li>Information the character learned in the City becomes crucial.</li>\n<li>The character is recognized by someone from their past (positive or negative).</li>\n<li>The character's family is implicated in crimes against Animals or Quadlings.</li>\n<li>The green spectacles malfunction, revealing uncomfortable truths.</li>\n<li>A character must navigate palace politics or slum underworld contacts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/southstairs', 'Southstairs'); return false;\">Southstairs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/political-navigation', 'Political Navigation'); return false;\">Political Navigation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/green-sight', 'Green Sight'); return false;\">Green Sight</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/palace-servant', 'Palace Servant'); return false;\">Palace Servant (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/emerald-city-urchin', 'Emerald City Urchin'); return false;\">Emerald City Urchin (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/common/evergreen-spectacles', 'Evergreen Spectacles'); return false;\">Evergreen Spectacles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/true-sight-spectacles', 'True Sight Spectacles'); return false;\">True-Sight Spectacles</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I've seen things beyond their Desert that would shatter their small certainties.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Deadly Desert surrounds Oz on all sides, turning living flesh to sand and making passage nearly impossible. Yet some have crossed it\u2014the Wizard in his balloon, Dorothy in her whirlwind-carried house, and others through means mysterious or magical. Those who come from beyond are Outlanders, and they bring with them perspectives, technologies, and ideas utterly foreign to Oz.</p>\n\n<p>Outlanders are rare, strange, and often regarded with suspicion. They don't fit into Oz's rigid social categories. Their accents are different, their customs peculiar, their assumptions about how the world works fundamentally alien. Some adapt and assimilate; others remain forever apart. All carry the weight of displacement\u2014they can never truly go home, and they can never fully belong.</p>\n\n<p>The known lands beyond the Desert include Ev (with its Nome King and mechanical underground), Ix (a land of shamanic traditions and spirit worship), Quox (associated with dragons and fire), and the mysterious place called Kansas, from which both the Wizard and Dorothy originated. Each land has its own cultures, magic systems, and relationships to Oz.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another increases by 1, reflecting the diverse origins of Outlanders.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by origin, but generally similar to other humans (maturity around 18, lifespan 70-90 years).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium.

You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to spot contradictions, illusions, or cultural assumptions that don't make logical sense. Additionally, you're immune to being charmed by effects that rely on shared cultural context or patriotic sentiment specific to Oz.</p>\n\n<h3>Adaptable Survivor</h3>\n<p>Crossing the Deadly Desert or surviving displacement has made you resourceful. You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Insight, Investigation, Perception, Survival. Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can replace one of your skill proficiencies with another from this list, representing your ability to quickly adapt to new situations.</p>\n\n<h3>Foreign Knowledge</h3>\n<p>You possess knowledge from beyond Oz. Choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technological Understanding:</strong> You gain proficiency with tinker's tools and advantage on Intelligence checks to understand or repair mechanical devices (especially useful for Tiktoks).</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative Magic:</strong> You know one cantrip from any spell list, representing a different magical tradition. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (your choice).</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Wealth:</strong> You start with twice the normal starting gold and have contacts in your homeland who can occasionally send resources (DM's discretion).</li>\n<li><strong>Spirit Sight:</strong> You can cast <em>detect magic</em> once per long rest without expending a spell slot, as you learned spirit-sensing techniques in your homeland.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Culture by Origin</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Evian:</strong> From the underground kingdom ruled by the Nome King, Evians are familiar with subterranean life, mechanical constructs, and rigid hierarchies. They tend toward pragmatism and have complicated relationships with surface life. Many have darker skin tones and are shorter than average Ozians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ixian:</strong> From a land of shamans and spirit worship, Ixians bring mystical knowledge foreign to Oz's magic traditions. They often seem otherworldly to Ozians, with different concepts of time, souls, and reality. They tend toward tall, slender builds and often have intricate tattoos representing spiritual journeys.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quoxian:</strong> From a volcanic land associated with dragons, Quoxians are comfortable with heat, fire, and danger. They're often seen as reckless or passionate by Ozian standards. Many have tanned or reddish-brown skin and dramatic features.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kansan (or Unknown):</strong> From a place called Kansas or other unknown lands beyond, these Outlanders are perhaps the strangest. They come from places without magic, without talking Animals, without color-coded provinces. Everything about Oz astonishes them, and their questions reveal uncomfortable truths. They tend to be from rural, agricultural backgrounds and are often bewildered by Oz's political complexities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Question of Return</h2>\n\n<p>Most Outlanders cannot return home. The Wizard failed to go back in his balloon. Dorothy left but kept returning, suggesting the Deadly Desert doesn't block her specifically\u2014or that she has access to magic (the Silver Shoes, the Ruby Slippers) that transcends normal rules. For most Outlanders, Oz is exile, permanent and absolute. This colors everything.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p>Names vary dramatically by origin:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Evian Names:</strong> Often earthy or gem-related\u2014Granite, Copper, Jade, Obsidian, Ruggedo</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ixian Names:</strong> Flowing and mystical\u2014Seraphina, Zephyr, Luminara, Cascade</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quoxian Names:</strong> Sharp and dramatic\u2014Blaze, Scorch, Cinder, Pyra, Ignatius</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kansan Names:</strong> Simple and familiar (to our world)\u2014Dorothy, Oscar (the Wizard), Henry, Em, regular American names</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying an Outlander</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I ask \"why\" about everything, much to locals' annoyance.</li>\n<li>I compare everything to \"how we did it back home.\"</li>\n<li>I'm fascinated by aspects of Oz that natives find mundane.</li>\n<li>I feel like I'm always performing, never quite belonging.</li>\n<li>I hoard reminders of home\u2014objects, stories, recipes.</li>\n<li>I unconsciously use phrases or gestures from my homeland that confuse Ozians.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Truth:</strong> Outsiders see clearly; I'll speak truths locals can't. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> I'll bring the best of both worlds together. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Superiority:</strong> My homeland's ways are obviously better. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> I'll use my unique knowledge for personal gain. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Belonging:</strong> I'll do whatever it takes to fit in here. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Return:</strong> I exist only to find a way home. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I left family/friends behind; I think of them constantly.</li>\n<li>Someone in Oz helped me when I first arrived; I owe them everything.</li>\n<li>I'm the last keeper of knowledge from my homeland; if I die, it dies.</li>\n<li>I was sent here on purpose with a specific mission.</li>\n<li>I found love in Oz; now I'm torn between two worlds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm insufferably condescending about how \"primitive\" Oz is.</li>\n<li>I'm paralyzed by homesickness and depression.</li>\n<li>I trust no one because I've been othered and betrayed.</li>\n<li>I appropriate Ozian culture clumsily, causing offense.</li>\n<li>I'm so desperate to belong that I'll compromise any principle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Wizard's Kin (Kansan)</h3>\n<p>If you're from Kansas or a similar non-magical world, replace <strong>Foreign Knowledge</strong> with <strong>Technological Prodigy:</strong> You gain proficiency in two types of artisan's tools and advantage on Intelligence checks related to mechanical devices, chemistry, or \"mundane\" sciences unknown in Oz.</p>\n\n<h3>Nome-Touched (Evian)</h3>\n<p>If you're from Ev or have connections to the underground kingdom, replace <strong>Adaptable Survivor</strong> with <strong>Subterranean Affinity:</strong> You have darkvision out to 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being frightened while underground, and you can communicate simple ideas with constructs (like Tiktoks) even if they can't normally speak.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Outlander characters are fish-out-of-water protagonists who can ask questions the DM wants explored. They're great for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlighting the strangeness of Ozian society to the audience.</li>\n<li>Bringing outside knowledge that solves problems in unexpected ways.</li>\n<li>Creating connections to lands beyond for expansion possibilities.</li>\n<li>Exploring themes of immigration, displacement, and belonging.</li>\n<li>Being the only one who questions \"that's just how things are.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be thoughtful about the \"chosen one from outside\" trope. Dorothy is special partly because she's an outsider, but that can become problematic if it implies Ozians can't solve their own problems.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/deadly-desert', 'The Deadly Desert'); return false;\">The Deadly Desert</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">The Wizard of Oz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dorothy-gale', 'Dorothy Gale'); return false;\">Dorothy Gale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/ev', 'Ev'); return false;\">Ev (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/ix', 'Ix'); return false;\">Ix (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/quox', 'Quox'); return false;\">Quox (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/kansas', 'Kansas'); return false;\">Kansas (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/foreign-diplomat', 'Foreign Diplomat'); return false;\">Foreign Diplomat (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/wizards-balloon', 'The Wizard's Balloon'); return false;\">The Wizard's Balloon</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<h1>Animals (Sentient)</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"We are Animals, not animals. The difference is a soul, a voice, and the capacity to be murdered rather than merely slaughtered.\"</em> \u2014 Dr. Dillamond</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>In Oz, some creatures are Animals (capital-A) \u2014 fully sentient, speaking beings with souls, cultures, and rights. Others are animals (lowercase-a) \u2014 non-sentient beasts. The line between them is one of the most contested and dangerous questions in Ozian society. Animals have been systematically persecuted, stripped of rights, and in many cases forcibly <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> \u2014 their ability to speak magically removed, reducing them to the status of mere animals.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals is central to the political horror of Oz. It began subtly under <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">the Wizard's</a> regime and intensified over time. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a>, once home to Animal professors like the goat <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a>, banned Animal faculty. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> was infiltrated and destroyed. Animals were required to register with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">the Gale Force</a>, then stripped of citizenship, then hunted.</p>\n\n<p>Playing an Animal character means playing someone whose personhood is constantly questioned, whose rights can be revoked at any moment, and who must navigate a society built on their oppression. It also means playing a character with rich cultural traditions, deep community bonds, and the strength that comes from surviving systematic dehumanization.</p>\n\n<h2>The Animal Question</h2>\n\n<p>What makes an Animal different from an animal? Ozians have debated this for generations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Soul Theory:</strong> Animals have souls granted by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> or awakened through unknown means. This is the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a> view.</li>\n<li><strong>The Denial:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionist</a> orthodoxy claims Animals don't have souls and thus aren't truly people. This justifies persecution.</li>\n<li><strong>The Reform Position:</strong> Some Unionists argue Animals do have souls and deserve rights, creating internal church conflict.</li>\n<li><strong>The Scientific Mystery:</strong> Scholars like Dr. Dillamond sought biological explanations but were silenced before finding answers.</li>\n<li><strong>The Spontaneous Awakening:</strong> Some believe animals can spontaneously become Animals under certain conditions, though this is unproven.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Playing an Animal: General Considerations</h2>\n\n<p>All Animal characters share certain realities regardless of species:</p>\n\n<h3>Social Persecution</h3>\n<p>You face discrimination ranging from social slights to active violence. In some eras and regions, being an Animal is a death sentence. You must choose how your character responds: resistance, hiding, collaboration, or simple survival.</p>\n\n<h3>Registration and Documentation</h3>\n<p>In many periods, Animals must register with authorities, wear identifying markers, or carry papers. Failure to do so can result in arrest, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silencing</a>, or worse. Some Animals refuse on principle; others comply to survive; still others use forged papers.</p>\n\n<h3>The Question of Eating Meat</h3>\n<p>If lions and bears are people, what do they eat? This creates moral complexity. Some Animals are vegetarian by choice or necessity. Others eat animals (lowercase) and live with the guilt or justify it as natural. Some radical Animals refuse to eat any creature, sentient or not. This often creates tension between predator and prey Animals.</p>\n\n<h3>Animal Culture vs. Animal Nature</h3>\n<p>Animal characters balance cultural identity (Lion society, Bear scholarship traditions, etc.) with their physical nature (carnivore instincts, flight capabilities, etc.). This tension between civilization and nature is ever-present.</p>\n\n<h3>Community and Solidarity</h3>\n<p>Animals often band together across species lines. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> united different bird species. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> includes mammals, birds, and others. Shared oppression creates bonds that transcend natural divisions.</p>\n\n<h2>Mechanical Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Animal player characters use modified racial traits that account for both their animal nature and their sentient status:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Size Variation:</strong> Animals range from Small (many birds, young bears) to Large (elephants, adult bears). Large PCs should discuss with DM.</li>\n<li><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Many Animals have claws, beaks, or other natural weapons, but using them can be seen as \"savage.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Movement Types:</strong> Flying Animals have special movement rules. Swimming Animals have aquatic advantages.</li>\n<li><strong>Speech and Silencing:</strong> The constant threat of being <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> (forcibly stripped of speech) hangs over all Animals.</li>\n<li><strong>Tools and Equipment:</strong> Animals may struggle with equipment designed for human hands, requiring adaptive tools or magic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Types of Animals</h2>\n\n<p>The following pages detail specific Animal types:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals</a> \u2014 Bears, Lions, Wolves, Tigers, Elephants, and more</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Birds</a> \u2014 Eagles, Crows, Owls, Songbirds, and the Conference tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">Reptiles & Amphibians</a> \u2014 The less common Animal types</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/fish-question', 'Fish Question'); return false;\">The Question of Fish</a> \u2014 Are fish Animals? The debate continues</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/hybrid-uncertain', 'Hybrid Uncertain'); return false;\">Hybrid & Uncertain Status</a> \u2014 Kalidahs, magical creations, and edge cases</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Historical Context</h2>\n\n<h3>The Golden Age (Pre-Wizard)</h3>\n<p>Before <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">the Wizard</a>, Animals lived relatively freely. They held positions of authority, taught at universities, and participated fully in society. This wasn't utopia \u2014 prejudice existed \u2014 but Animals had legal rights and social standing.</p>\n\n<h3>The Wizard's Suppression</h3>\n<p>The Wizard began subtle campaigns against Animals: propaganda suggesting they were dangerous, policies limiting their roles, encouragement of discrimination. By the end of his reign, Animals were being actively hunted. Dr. Dillamond's murder at Shiz marked a turning point.</p>\n\n<h3>The Conference of the Birds</h3>\n<p>A political organization of Animal birds that advocated for Animal rights and coordinated resistance. It was infiltrated by government agents and destroyed, with many members killed or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a>. Its destruction scattered the Animal resistance and created lasting trauma.</p>\n\n<h3>Current Era (Variable by Campaign)</h3>\n<p>Depending on when your campaign is set, Animals may be in hiding, fighting active resistance, slowly regaining rights, or still facing genocide. The GM determines the current state of Animal persecution.</p>\n\n<h2>Passing as animal</h2>\n\n<p>Some Animals choose to \"pass\" as non-sentient animals to avoid persecution. They don't speak in public, pretend to be pets or working animals, and hide their intelligence. This is survival but comes at a terrible psychological cost. See the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a> for mechanics.</p>\n\n<h2>The Underground Railroad</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a> is a network dedicated to smuggling Animals to safety, usually to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling Country</a> or the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkus</a> where central authority is weaker. It's dangerous, secretive, and essential. Many Animal PCs have connections to it.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Guidance</h2>\n\n<p>Animal persecution is an allegory for real-world oppression. Handle it with care:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Session Zero:</strong> Discuss comfort levels with themes of genocide, dehumanization, and systematic oppression.</li>\n<li><strong>Lines and Veils:</strong> Establish what can be depicted on-screen vs. implied off-screen.</li>\n<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Animal PCs should have meaningful choices, not just suffer helplessly.</li>\n<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Not all humans are oppressors; not all Animals are noble. Show the full range.</li>\n<li><strong>Hope:</strong> Even in darkness, resistance, community, and small victories matter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Birds (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">The Conference of the Birds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced (Condition)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/animal-etiquette', 'Animal Etiquette'); return false;\">Animal Etiquette (Special Skill)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/former-animal', 'Former Animal'); return false;\">Former Animal (Background)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I am Brrr, and I have a soul.\"</em> \u2014 The Cowardly Lion</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Mammalian Animals are perhaps the most visible and most persecuted in Oz. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr the Lion</a>, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Princess Nastoya the Elephant</a>, and countless unnamed Bears, Wolves, Tigers, and others have shaped Ozian history. They are scholars, warriors, leaders, and victims. Their size, strength, and predatory nature make them particularly threatening to human supremacists, leading to targeted violence and suppression.</p>\n\n<p>Each mammalian species has developed distinct cultures and traditions. Bears are known for scholarship and record-keeping. Lions navigate complex social hierarchies and the weight of being symbols (the \"cowardly lion\" legend haunts <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr</a> throughout his life). Elephants maintain matriarchal societies and long memories. Wolves form tight pack structures that emphasize loyalty. Each species brings unique perspectives and challenges.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits (Mammals - General)</h2>\n\n<p>All mammalian Animals share certain baseline traits, modified by specific species:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species (see below)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Mammalian Animals live roughly as long as their animal counterparts would naturally\u2014Bears and Elephants may reach 50-60 years, Lions and Wolves 20-30, smaller mammals less. However, sentience seems to extend natural lifespans somewhat.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species and age. Most are Medium, but some (like Elephants or adult Bears) are Large. Discuss Large PCs with your DM.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species, typically 30-40 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one species language (Leonine, Ursine, Lupine, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Animal Senses</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell or hearing. Your keen senses mark you as an Animal, making it harder to pass as human.</p>\n\n<h3>Natural Weapons</h3>\n<p>You have claws, fangs, or other natural weapons. You can make unarmed strikes dealing 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing or piercing damage (your choice). However, using your natural weapons in \"civilized\" settings marks you as savage and may trigger hostile reactions. Many Animals refuse to use them except in dire circumstances.</p>\n\n<h3>Thick Hide or Fur</h3>\n<p>When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Target of Persecution</h3>\n<p>You are subject to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">Gale Force</a> registration laws, social discrimination, and potential violence. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with openly anti-Animal NPCs. However, you have advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> or sympathetic communities.</p>\n\n<h2>Species Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Bear (Ursine)</h3>\n\n<p>Bears are known for their scholarly traditions. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a> once had multiple Bear professors before the purges. Bears value knowledge, record-keeping, and thoughtful analysis. They're often larger and slower than other Animals but possess great strength and wisdom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (young) or Large (adult, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (your size and build make you less agile)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scholar's Tradition:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check related to recalling lore or information you've read, you can add double your proficiency bonus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powerful Build:</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hibernation Knowledge:</strong> You require only 4 hours of sleep during a long rest instead of 6 (though you still need 8 hours for a full rest). During winter months, you feel a strong urge to sleep more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Bear characters often struggle between their intellectual pursuits and society's view of them as dangerous beasts. Many were or knew professors who were purged from <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz</a>. The loss of scholarly community weighs heavily.</p>\n\n<h3>Lion (Leonine)</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr</a>, the famous \"Cowardly\" Lion, has shaped how Ozians view all Lions\u2014often unfairly. Lions navigate complex social hierarchies, both within their own prides and in broader Ozian society. They're seen as symbols: courage, nobility, ferocity, or (thanks to Brrr's legend) cowardice. This symbolic weight is a burden.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (females, young males) or Large (adult males, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 35 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regal Presence:</strong> Despite persecution, Lions carry themselves with dignity. You have proficiency in the Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice). Additionally, when you make a Charisma check to assert authority or demand respect, you can add your Strength modifier instead of Charisma (minimum +0).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pride Tactics:</strong> When an ally within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the attacker. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you have advantage on your next attack roll against them before the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hunter's Instinct:</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to stalk prey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Lion characters often grapple with the Brrr legend and expectations of nobility or courage. Some embrace the reputation; others are crushed by it. See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr's story</a> for the complexity of Lion identity in Oz.</p>\n\n<h3>Wolf (Lupine)</h3>\n\n<p>Wolves emphasize pack, loyalty, and collective survival. They work together instinctively, communicate through body language and subtle signals, and prioritize the group over the individual. In the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>, Wolves often serve as coordinators and tacticians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pack Tactics:</strong> You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. This represents your instinctive coordination with allies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keen Tracker:</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures and can track at a fast pace without penalty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Howl of the Pack:</strong> As an action, you can howl to signal allies within 1 mile. Allies who hear it know your general direction and emotional state. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. (Note: Howling may attract unwanted attention in hostile territory.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Wolf characters struggle when separated from pack/community. They thrive in groups and suffer alone. Many feel torn between Animal pack bonds and the diverse alliances of the resistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Tiger (Feline)</h3>\n\n<p>Tigers are solitary, fierce, and rare. Ivory Tigers, mentioned in the novels, are particularly exotic and endangered. Tigers are often stereotyped as dangerous and unpredictable, making them prime targets for <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silencing</a> or elimination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium or Large (DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 35 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solitary Hunter:</strong> You have advantage on attack rolls when you're the only ally within 30 feet of the target. You're most effective when working alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ambush Predator:</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in natural terrain (forests, grasslands, jungles). Additionally, during the first round of combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that haven't taken a turn yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pounce:</strong> If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you can make one additional claw attack against it as a bonus action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Tiger characters are often loners by nature but may join groups out of necessity. They face intense prejudice and are frequently hunted. Ivory Tigers may be nearly extinct, making survivors precious and endangered.</p>\n\n<h3>Elephant (Proboscidean)</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Princess Nastoya</a>, matriarch of her people, led the Elephants through exile and trauma. Elephants maintain long memories, matriarchal traditions, and deep wisdom. They're among the largest Animals, making them impossible to ignore and easy to target.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Large (Elephants cannot be Medium; discuss with your DM about playing a Large PC)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Matriarch's Memory:</strong> Elephants never forget. You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information you've personally encountered. Additionally, you can perfectly recall any conversation or event you experienced within the past year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trunk Dexterity:</strong> Your trunk can manipulate objects, carry up to 30 pounds, and function as a natural \"hand\" for tasks. You can use your trunk to grapple creatures or manipulate objects while your feet remain planted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powerful Build:</strong> You count as Huge when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thick Hide:</strong> Your AC calculation from natural armor becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier (instead of 12).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charge:</strong> If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a gore or slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Elephant characters carry the weight of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Nastoya's</a> legacy and their people's persecution. They remember every injustice, every lost family member, every broken promise. This can be both strength and burden.</p>\n\n<h3>Badger, Ape, and Other Mammals</h3>\n\n<p>Other mammalian species exist as Animals: Badgers (tenacious diggers), Apes (tool-users and climbers), Foxes (cunning survivors), and more. Work with your DM to create appropriate traits based on the species' natural abilities and cultural role in Oz.</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Guidelines:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>+2 to one ability, +1 to another based on species strengths</li>\n<li>One or two species-specific abilities (burrowing, climbing, etc.)</li>\n<li>Natural weapons appropriate to the species</li>\n<li>Cultural background related to their role in Animal society</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Burden of Being a Predator</h2>\n\n<p>Carnivorous Animals face an additional moral weight: if they eat meat, they may be eating animals (lowercase-a) that could potentially become Animals. Or worse, in dark times, the meat industry may be secretly processing <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> Animals. Many predatory Animals become vegetarian, suffering malnutrition rather than risk cannibalism. Others eat and don't think too hard about it. Some justify it philosophically. This creates internal conflict and external judgment.</p>\n\n<h2>Animal Society and Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Before the persecution, Animals had rich cultural traditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bears</strong> maintained vast libraries and taught at universities</li>\n<li><strong>Lions</strong> held courts and settled disputes through formal combat or debate</li>\n<li><strong>Wolves</strong> organized pack councils with democratic elements</li>\n<li><strong>Elephants</strong> passed down oral histories spanning generations</li>\n<li><strong>Tigers</strong> practiced solitary contemplation and hunting rituals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Much of this has been lost or driven underground. Animals fighting to preserve these traditions risk everything.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Mammalian Animal PCs bring physical power and cultural weight to the party. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Size Challenges:</strong> Large Animals may struggle with dungeon doors, city streets, or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/witch-broom', 'Witch's Broom'); return false;\">Witch's Brooms</a></li>\n<li><strong>Prejudice:</strong> Vary how NPCs react\u2014some hostile, some sympathetic, most fearful</li>\n<li><strong>Practical Problems:</strong> How do Lions open doors? How do Elephants buy clothes? These details matter</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Loss:</strong> NPCs who remember \"the before times\" can provide poignant moments</li>\n<li><strong>Hope and Resistance:</strong> Even in darkness, Animal communities support each other</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Birds (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr (The Cowardly Lion)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Princess Nastoya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced (Condition)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/conference-veteran', 'Conference Veteran'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds Veteran (Background)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Now even the sky isn't safe.\"</em> \u2014 A surviving Conference member</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Bird Animals occupy a unique position in Oz: they can fly, making them both valuable messengers and difficult to capture. Yet this mobility also made them prime targets when <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">the Gale Force</a> decided to eliminate organized Animal resistance. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> was the most organized Animal political movement in history\u2014and its destruction remains one of the great traumas of Animal society.</p>\n\n<p>Birds range from tiny songbirds to massive eagles. Some, like Crows, have developed extensive intelligence networks. Others, like Owls, are associated with wisdom, death omens, or both. Eagles are warriors and leaders. Each species brings different capabilities and cultural traditions, but all share the gift and curse of flight.</p>\n\n<p>Before the persecution, Birds served as messengers, scouts, scholars, and diplomats. Now, many hide their sentience, pretending to be mere birds. Others joined the resistance, using their aerial advantage for reconnaissance and communication. Still others were captured, caged, and <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a>\u2014their wings clipped, their voices stolen.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits (Birds - General)</h2>\n\n<p>All Bird Animals share certain baseline traits, modified by specific species:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species (see below)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Bird Animals live roughly as long as their species naturally would, though sentience seems to extend lifespans. Crows and Ravens may reach 50+ years, songbirds 10-20, Eagles 30-40.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small (most songbirds, small crows) or Medium (eagles, large owls, ravens). Tiny birds are generally not playable without heavy modification.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>25-30 feet walking, 50-60 feet flying (varies by species)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and Avian (with species-specific dialects)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Flight</h3>\n<p>You have a flying speed listed in your species traits. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor, or if your wings are clipped or bound. If you're knocked prone, fall unconscious, or are otherwise incapacitated while flying, you fall unless you can hover. This ability makes you incredibly valuable\u2014and incredibly targeted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wing Clipping:</strong> In some eras and regions, authorities clip the wings of captured Bird Animals, permanently removing their ability to fly. This is considered a form of torture and mutilation. A clipped bird can sometimes regain flight through powerful healing magic, but the psychological trauma persists.</p>\n\n<h3>Keen Vision</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. You can see details at great distances that others miss.</p>\n\n<h3>Hollow Bones</h3>\n<p>Your bones are light but fragile. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid being grappled or restrained, but you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would knock you prone or push you.</p>\n\n<h3>Talons or Beak</h3>\n<p>You have a natural weapon\u2014talons or beak. You can make unarmed strikes dealing 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier piercing or slashing damage. Your hands (wing-claws) may be less dexterous than human hands, potentially affecting tool use (DM's discretion).</p>\n\n<h3>Conference Legacy</h3>\n<p>All Bird Animals carry the memory of the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a>, whether they personally remember it or not. You have advantage on Intelligence checks related to Animal history and political movements. Additionally, when you meet other Bird Animals, you can usually establish trust quickly through shared cultural references and grief.</p>\n\n<h2>Species Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Eagle (Aquiline)</h3>\n\n<p>Eagles are warriors, leaders, and symbols of freedom. They're large, powerful, and difficult to keep captive. Many Eagles fought openly during the Animal resistance and paid the price. Those who survive carry battle scars and deep conviction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet walking, 60 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Raptor's Dive:</strong> If you fly at least 30 feet toward a target and then hit it with a talon attack on the same turn, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage. If the target is a creature smaller than you, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Battlefield Commander:</strong> You have proficiency in Intimidation. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in combat, that ally gains advantage on their next attack roll and adds your Wisdom modifier to the damage if they hit (minimum +1).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Superior Vision:</strong> You can see clearly up to 1 mile away as if it were only 100 feet. Additionally, you ignore lightly obscured conditions when relying on sight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Eagle characters are often military veterans, resistance fighters, or community leaders. They struggle with survivor's guilt and the weight of failed uprisings. Many knew members of the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a> personally.</p>\n\n<h3>Crow/Raven (Corvid)</h3>\n\n<p>Crows and Ravens are intelligence-gatherers, tricksters, and survivors. They're brilliant, adaptable, and deeply social within their own kind. Corvid intelligence networks survived the purges better than most, making them invaluable to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small (Crow) or Medium (Raven, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 25 feet walking, 50 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mimicry:</strong> You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they're imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check. This ability has saved countless Corvids from capture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intelligence Network:</strong> You can communicate with other Corvids (sentient or not) within sight. Non-sentient crows will perform simple tasks for you (delivering small objects, watching locations, making noise as distraction). Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather information in cities or settlements where crows are present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clever Mind:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Investigation, or Sleight of Hand. Additionally, you can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for Sleight of Hand checks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Omen of Death:</strong> Whether true or superstition, Corvids are associated with death and ill omens. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against superstitious creatures, but disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with those same creatures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Corvid characters are often spies, information brokers, or messengers. They know everyone's secrets\u2014which makes them valuable and dangerous. Many operated in the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a> as intelligence coordinators.</p>\n\n<h3>Owl (Strigine)</h3>\n\n<p>Owls are associated with wisdom, night, and death. They're silent fliers, nocturnal hunters, and often scholars or mystics. Their connection to night and death gives them an air of the uncanny that makes other Ozians uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small (most owls) or Medium (great horned owl, eagle owl)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 25 feet walking, 50 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Silent Flight:</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while flying. Your wings make no sound, allowing you to approach or escape undetected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Darkvision:</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nocturnal:</strong> You're most active at night. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in darkness or dim light. However, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight in bright sunlight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scholar's Wisdom:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, Insight, Medicine, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check to recall information or notice hidden details, you can reroll the die once and must use the new roll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Owl characters are often solitary scholars, mystics, or watchers. They see things others miss\u2014literally and metaphorically. Many feel disconnected from the broader Animal community due to their nocturnal nature and unsettling reputation.</p>\n\n<h3>Songbird (Passerine)</h3>\n\n<p>Songbirds\u2014thrushes, sparrows, finches, nightingales\u2014are small, vulnerable, and numerous. They were often dismissed as unimportant, which ironically helped some survive. Songbird messengers can fly unnoticed where larger birds would be shot. Their voices carry warnings, songs, and coded messages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 20 feet walking, 50 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Melodic Voice:</strong> You have proficiency in Performance. Additionally, you can use your song to communicate emotions and simple concepts to any creature within hearing range, regardless of language barriers. This isn't magical, but it's remarkably effective.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unassuming:</strong> Your small size and \"harmless\" appearance work to your advantage. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to appear innocent or non-threatening. Additionally, you're often underestimated\u2014use it wisely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Swift Flight:</strong> Your flying speed is not reduced when moving through tight spaces that would normally require squeezing (as long as they're large enough for your actual size).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fragile Frame:</strong> Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 per level (minimum 1 hit point per level). You're more vulnerable than larger Animals, but you compensate with speed and cunning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Songbird characters are survivors who've learned to use their perceived weakness as strength. They're messengers, spies, and the eyes of the resistance. Many carry messages for the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Underground Railroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Other Bird Species</h3>\n\n<p>Other bird species exist as Animals: Hawks, Falcons, Herons, Woodpeckers, and more. Work with your DM to create appropriate traits based on natural abilities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Conference of the Birds</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> was the pinnacle of Animal political organization. Founded in the early years of persecution, it united bird species in coordinated resistance and advocacy. The Conference held secret meetings, coordinated information networks, lobbied (unsuccessfully) for Animal rights, and planned collective action.</p>\n\n<p>It was infiltrated by government agents, betrayed by collaborators, and violently destroyed. Many Conference members were killed, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a>, or imprisoned in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/southstairs', 'Southstairs'); return false;\">Southstairs</a>. The destruction scattered bird Animals across Oz and created lasting trauma. Yet the memory persists, and some say the Conference never truly died\u2014it merely went deeper underground.</p>\n\n<p>Bird PCs often have personal or family connections to the Conference. Perhaps a grandparent was a member. Perhaps they survived the purge as a fledgling. The Conference is both inspiration and cautionary tale.</p>\n\n<h2>Flight and Freedom</h2>\n\n<p>Flight represents freedom\u2014which is why authorities target it. In some regions, flying Animals are shot on sight. In others, they must register their flight patterns with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">the Gale Force</a>. Some cities ban flying entirely within city limits. The sky should be freedom, but it's become another space of surveillance and danger.</p>\n\n<p>Many bird Animals choose to walk rather than fly in public, hiding their greatest gift to survive. This self-imposed limitation weighs heavily. Imagine having wings and being afraid to use them.</p>\n\n<h2>Messenger Traditions</h2>\n\n<p>Despite persecution, bird Animals continue serving as messengers\u2014it's both livelihood and calling. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Underground Railroad</a> relies heavily on bird messengers. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> uses them to coordinate across distances. Even <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese</a> nobles employ bird messengers (often treating them as mere animals, which is both offensive and occasionally useful cover).</p>\n\n<p>Messenger birds use coded messages, multiple routes, and careful timing. They know they're targets\u2014one well-placed arrow ends everything. Yet they fly anyway because communication is resistance.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Bird Animal PCs add mobility and vulnerability to the party:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flight is Powerful:</strong> Be prepared for creative aerial solutions to problems</li>\n<li><strong>Flight is Dangerous:</strong> Archers, weather, exhaustion, and wing damage are constant threats</li>\n<li><strong>Size Matters:</strong> Small birds face different challenges than Medium birds</li>\n<li><strong>Conference Survivors:</strong> NPCs who remember the Conference are either inspiring or broken</li>\n<li><strong>Messaging:</strong> Bird PCs may be asked to carry messages\u2014some safe, some deadly</li>\n<li><strong>The Temptation to Hide:</strong> It's easier to pretend to be a non-sentient bird; address this temptation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">The Conference of the Birds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced (Condition)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/southstairs', 'Southstairs'); return false;\">Southstairs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/conference-veteran', 'Conference Veteran'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds Veteran (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/messenger-bird-clockwork', 'Messenger Bird Clockwork'); return false;\">Messenger Bird (Clockwork)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

As if the temperature of our blood determines the warmth of our souls.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Reptilian and amphibian Animals are rare, poorly understood, and often feared. Unlike the mammal and bird Animals who have established cultures and histories, reptilian Animals exist in the margins\u2014mentioned in whispers, seen rarely, and subject to even more suspicion than their warm-blooded cousins. The question of whether <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> are Animals, beasts, or something else entirely further complicates matters.</p>\n\n<p>Snakes, lizards, frogs, toads, salamanders, and turtles may or may not be sentient. There are no confirmed Snake professors at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz</a>, no Frog delegates to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> (despite the name suggesting cross-species unity), and no well-known Turtle scholars. Yet occasional reports surface of speaking serpents in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling marshes</a>, wise turtles offering cryptic advice, or lizards serving as guides in the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkus</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The scarcity might be real\u2014perhaps few reptiles achieve sentience. Or it might be concealment\u2014reptiles are easier to mistake for non-sentient animals, making \"passing\" simpler and safer. Or perhaps cold-blooded Animals simply don't integrate into warm-blooded society, maintaining separate communities unknown to mammals and birds.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits (Reptile/Amphibian - General)</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the diversity and rarity of reptilian/amphibian Animals, these traits are more variable than other Animal types. Work with your DM to create a character appropriate to your specific species.</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species (see examples below)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Highly variable. Turtles may live 100+ years, frogs 10-20, snakes 20-30. Sentience seems to extend lifespans.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small (most frogs, small snakes, lizards) to Medium (large snakes, turtles, crocodilians)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>20-30 feet, with climb or swim speeds depending on species</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one language (Serpentine, Batrachian, etc. \u2014if a language even exists)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Cold-Blooded</h3>\n<p>You are ectothermic, relying on external heat sources. In cold environments (below 50\u00b0F), you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. In warm environments (above 70\u00b0F), you function normally or even gain advantage on certain checks (DM's discretion). You can enter a state of torpor during extreme cold, reducing your need for food but also rendering you vulnerable.</p>\n\n<h3>Natural Camouflage</h3>\n<p>Your scales or skin help you blend into natural environments. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in natural terrain matching your species' habitat (swamps for frogs, forests for snakes, etc.).</p>\n\n<h3>Limited Animal Culture</h3>\n<p>Unlike mammals and birds, you have little connection to broader Animal political movements. You weren't represented in the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a>, and the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> has few reptilian members. This isolation is both curse (no support network) and blessing (less targeted by persecution\u2014maybe). You feel like an outsider even among outsiders.</p>\n\n<h2>Species Examples</h2>\n\n<h3>Snake (Serpentine)</h3>\n\n<p>Snakes are feared, associated with evil and deception across many cultures\u2014including in Oz. A speaking snake triggers primal unease. Yet some snakes are wise, others merely trying to survive with a body plan poorly suited to tool use or social integration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small or Medium (large constrictors)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet, climb 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Serpentine Body:</strong> You have no limbs. You can manipulate objects using your mouth and coils but have disadvantage on Strength checks requiring fine manipulation. Many tools and weapons are unusable without adaptation. However, your flexible body allows you to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 6 inches in diameter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Venomous Bite (Optional):</strong> Some snakes have venom. If you choose this option, your bite attack (1d4 piercing damage) also forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 2d4 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> You have proficiency in Perception. Additionally, you can sense vibrations in the ground, giving you tremorsense out to 10 feet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Snake characters face extreme prejudice and practical challenges. How do you open doors? Write? Use tools? Some snakes use <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/animated-helper-construct', 'Animated Helper Construct'); return false;\">magical assistants</a> or partner with other Animals in symbiotic relationships.</p>\n\n<h3>Frog/Toad (Batrachian)</h3>\n\n<p>Frogs and toads inhabit marshes and wet environments, particularly in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling Country</a>. Some <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;\">Quadlings</a> claim to have learned <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon trance</a> techniques from frog spirits\u2014suggesting an ancient relationship.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 25 feet, swim 25 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amphibious:</strong> You can breathe both air and water, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jumper:</strong> Your jump distance is tripled. Additionally, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength when calculating jump distances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marsh Walker:</strong> You ignore difficult terrain in swamps, marshes, and wetlands. Additionally, you have advantage on saves against diseases common in wet environments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Poisonous Skin (Optional):</strong> Some frogs secrete toxins. Creatures that grapple you or hit you with unarmed strikes must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or take 1d4 poison damage and have disadvantage on their next attack roll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Frog characters often have connections to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;\">Quadling</a> communities and <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon</a> spiritual traditions. They're often seen as mystical or uncanny.</p>\n\n<h3>Turtle/Tortoise (Chelonian)</h3>\n\n<p>Turtles are ancient, patient, and resilient. They carry their homes on their backs and measure time in decades. A turtle who claims to remember events from a century ago might be telling the truth\u2014or might be something stranger than a simple Animal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small or Medium</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 20 feet (slow but steady), swim 20 feet (aquatic turtles)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Armor:</strong> Your shell provides excellent protection. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 15 + your Dexterity modifier. You can't use a shield and still gain this benefit. This is significantly better protection than most Animals, but it comes with weight and inflexibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shell Defense:</strong> As an action, you can withdraw into your shell. While withdrawn, your AC increases by 2, you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws, you have resistance to all damage, but your speed is 0, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ancient Memory:</strong> You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall historical information or events that happened more than 20 years ago. Turtles remember.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Turtle characters are often mentors, historians, or wanderers who've outlived everyone they knew. They move through time differently than others.</p>\n\n<h3>Lizard (Lacertilian)</h3>\n\n<p>Lizards are quick, adaptable, and often overlooked. They exist in the cracks of society\u2014literally and figuratively. Some serve as spies or scouts for the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">resistance</a>; others simply try to survive unnoticed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small or Medium (monitor lizards, iguanas)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet, climb 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check (as long as the surface could reasonably support your weight).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tail Escape:</strong> When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shed your tail and immediately move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Your tail regrows over the course of a week. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until your tail regrows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chameleon Skin (Optional):</strong> Some lizards can change color. As an action, you can shift your skin color to match your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for the next 10 minutes. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Lizard characters are often loners, scouts, or urban survivors who've learned to thrive in the margins.</p>\n\n<h2>The Dragon Question</h2>\n\n<p>Are <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> reptilian Animals? This is fiercely debated. Dragons are clearly sentient and speak multiple languages. They're reptilian in appearance. But they're also massive, magical, and possibly not natural creatures at all. Some scholars argue Dragons are Animals. Others say they're something older, stranger, or more dangerous. Most people just try to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> for more information on playing draconic characters.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Reptilian/amphibian Animals are rare and mysterious.

      "title": "The Question of Fish",
      "category": null,
      "content": "<h1>The Question of Fish</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"If fish have souls, then half of Oz is guilty of cannibalism. So we've decided they don't. Convenient, isn't it?\"</em> \u2014 A cynical Unionist theologian</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Do fish have souls? Are they Animals (capital-A) or merely animals? This question torments philosophers, theologians, and anyone who's ever eaten a meal in Oz. The answer determines whether fish markets are food vendors or sites of ongoing genocide. The question has never been definitively settled\u2014perhaps because settling it would be too disturbing.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike mammals, birds, and even reptiles, there are no confirmed cases of a fish speaking, attending university, or participating in Animal political movements. No fish joined the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> (though the name might suggest otherwise). No fish professor taught at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz</a>. No fish member of the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> has ever been documented.</p>\n\n<p>Yet absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Fish live in an environment inaccessible to most Ozians. How would a speaking fish even communicate with air-breathers? If fish have cultures, societies, and thoughts, they exist in a realm humans and most Animals can't easily access. The silence might be separation, not absence of sentience.</p>\n\n<h2>The Theological Debate</h2>\n\n<h3>The Unionist Position</h3>\n<p>Orthodox <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a> holds that fish do not have souls. This is doctrinally necessary\u2014if fish have souls, then eating fish is murder, and Ozian society would collapse. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'The Unnamed God'); return false;\">Unnamed God</a> supposedly created fish as food for beings with souls. This reasoning sounds suspiciously similar to the arguments used to justify Animal persecution, which reformist Unionists quietly note.</p>\n\n<h3>The Lurlinite Position</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinites</a> are divided. Some argue <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> granted souls to all creatures. Others suggest fish are part of the natural world, blessed by Lurline but not sentient in the same way. Still others admit they don't know and practice vegetarianism to be safe.</p>\n\n<h3>The Animal Perspective</h3>\n<p>Many Animals refuse to eat fish specifically because of this uncertainty. If fish might be people, eating them risks committing the same crime being perpetrated against Animals themselves. This moral caution creates solidarity across uncertain boundaries.</p>\n\n<h3>The Coastal Question</h3>\n<p>In coastal Animal communities\u2014particularly in regions bordering the great lakes or the ocean beyond the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/deadly-desert', 'The Deadly Desert'); return false;\">Deadly Desert</a>\u2014some claim to have communicated with fish Animals. These reports are dismissed by inland authorities but taken seriously by those who live near water. A few <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">bird Animals</a>, particularly diving species, insist fish have spoken to them beneath the waves.</p>\n\n<h2>If Fish Are Animals: Playing a Fish Character</h2>\n\n<p>Your GM may allow fish Animal characters in campaigns focused on aquatic adventures, or to explore the question of sentience and recognition. This is experimental and requires DM approval and player creativity.</p>\n\n<h3>Racial Traits (Fish - Speculative)</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Highly variable by species. Some fish live only a few years; others (like certain sturgeon) may live decades.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small (most fish) to Medium (large fish). Tiny fish are generally unplayable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>5 feet walking (flopping), 40 feet swimming</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Aquan (underwater communication through movement, bioluminescence, and vibration), possibly Common with great difficulty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Aquatic</h3>\n<p>You can breathe only underwater and require water to survive. You can survive out of water for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour) before you begin suffocating. This makes land adventures extremely challenging without magical assistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Swim Speed</h3>\n<p>You have a swimming speed of 40 feet and can navigate underwater effortlessly. You ignore difficult terrain while swimming.</p>\n\n<h3>Invisible to Most</h3>\n<p>Because most Ozians don't believe fish are sentient, you can often move through fish markets, aquariums, and waterways without being recognized as a person. This is both advantage (you're not targeted like other Animals) and horror (you watch your kin being sold as food).</p>\n\n<h3>Communication Barrier</h3>\n<p>You cannot speak audibly underwater or in air. You communicate through gestures, water vibrations, and possibly limited telepathy (DM's discretion). Learning to communicate with land-dwellers requires magic, items like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/water-breathing-stone', 'Water Breathing Stone'); return false;\">water-breathing stones</a>, or creative solutions.</p>\n\n<h3>The Unacknowledged</h3>\n<p>Most Ozians will not recognize you as a person, even if you try to communicate. The societal assumption that fish aren't sentient is so deeply ingrained that you face not just persecution but *invisibility*\u2014perhaps the cruelest form of dehumanization.</p>\n\n<h2>The Weight of Uncertainty</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the fish question is the deliberate choice not to investigate. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a> could fund studies. Scholars could attempt underwater communication. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon</a> practitioners could seek fish spirits. But there's a collective turning away from the question, because answering it might require admitting to ongoing atrocity.</p>\n\n<p>Every fish market becomes a potential crime scene. Every fishing expedition might be hunting people. The uncertainty is morally comfortable in a deeply uncomfortable way\u2014and that comfort is precisely what makes it suspect.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot Hooks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A dying fish whispers something that sounds like words. Was it Animal speech or  chance? The party must investigate.</li>\n<li>The party encounters a coastal Animal community that insists fish are people and fishing is murder. Do they believe them?</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon</a> trance reveals contact with fish spirits. Were they real or hallucination?</li>\n<li>The party needs to cross a large body of water. If fish are sentient, how does that change their approach?</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Owl Animal</a> claims a fish told them something crucial. No one believes them.</li>\n<li>Fish markets are targeted by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>. The party must decide whose side they're on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Guidance</h2>\n\n<p>The fish question is body horror, existential dread, and moral uncertainty combined. Use it to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlight how societies choose comfortable lies over uncomfortable truths</li>\n<li>Parallel real-world debates about animal sentience and rights</li>\n<li>Create moral ambiguity\u2014there may be no right answer</li>\n<li>Make players genuinely uncertain about in-game choices</li>\n<li>Explore the horror of unknowing and the deliberate choice to remain ignorant</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Don't answer the question definitively unless your campaign requires it. The uncertainty is the point.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">Reptiles & Amphibians (Animal)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite Faith</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon Trance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('philosophy/animal-soul-debates', 'Animal Soul Debates'); return false;\">The Animal Soul Debates</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<h1>Hybrid & Uncertain Status</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I'm made of sofa cushions and palm fronds. Do I have a soul? I don't know. But I remember things, and I think, therefore... something.\"</em> \u2014 The Gump</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Not all potentially sentient creatures fit neatly into categories. Some are hybrids\u2014beings combining features of multiple species. Others are magical creations, assembled from parts or conjured by spells. Still others defy classification entirely. These beings exist in the margins of the already-marginal, unacknowledged even by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>, uncertain even of their own status.</p>\n\n<p>The most famous examples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kalidahs:</strong> Bear-tiger hybrids with bodies of bears and heads of tigers, known for ferocity and territorial behavior</li>\n<li><strong>The Gump:</strong> An assembled being created from a sofa, palm fronds, and the head of a stag, brought to life by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-ozma', 'Princess Ozma'); return false;\">Princess Ozma</a></li>\n<li><strong>Magical Creations:</strong> Beings created through spells from the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">Grimmerie</a> or other sources</li>\n<li><strong>Chimeras:</strong> Other hybrid creatures that may or may not have sentience</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These beings raise profound questions: If you're created rather than born, do you have a soul? If you're a hybrid, which cultural traditions claim you? If no one acknowledges your sentience, are you still a person?</p>\n\n<h2>Kalidahs</h2>\n\n<p>Kalidahs are perhaps the most debated case. They have the bodies of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Bears</a> and heads of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Tigers</a>, combine the strength of both, and are notoriously aggressive. They inhabit forests, particularly in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a>, where they're feared by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/vinkan', 'Vinkan'); return false;\">Vinkans</a> and other inhabitants.</p>\n\n<h3>Are Kalidahs Animals?</h3>\n\n<p>The evidence is contradictory:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments For Sentience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some travelers report Kalidahs speaking, though this is often dismissed as hallucination or deception</li>\n<li>Kalidahs demonstrate complex hunting strategies that suggest planning and coordination</li>\n<li>They're clearly intelligent enough to be feared as more than mere beasts</li>\n<li>If Bears and Tigers are Animals, why wouldn't a Bear-Tiger hybrid also be sentient?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments Against Sentience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Kalidah has ever participated in Animal society or politics</li>\n<li>They attack without apparent moral consideration</li>\n<li>No Kalidah has ever requested rights or tried to communicate beyond roaring</li>\n<li>They may be magical constructs without true souls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Uncomfortable Middle:</strong> Perhaps Kalidahs *are* sentient but are so traumatized by their hybrid nature\u2014rejected by both Bears and Tigers, hunted by everyone else\u2014that they've become feral. Perhaps they have souls but have given up on society. This possibility is deeply disturbing.</p>\n\n<h3>Playing a Kalidah (If Allowed)</h3>\n\n<p>Some GMs may allow Kalidah characters to explore themes of identity, rejection, and monstrosity. This requires careful handling and player maturity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (young) or Large (adult)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 feet, climb 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hybrid Nature:</strong> You combine features of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Bears</a> and <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Tigers</a>. You gain the natural weapons trait from both (claws and bite), dealing 1d8 + Strength modifier slashing or piercing damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fearsome Presence:</strong> You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. However, you have disadvantage on all other Charisma checks with creatures that recognize you as a Kalidah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Territorial Instinct:</strong> When you're in an area you've claimed as territory (DM's discretion), you have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. However, you feel intense discomfort when away from your territory for extended periods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rejected by All:</strong> Neither Bear nor Tiger Animal communities acknowledge you as kin. You have no cultural heritage to claim, no community to belong to. This isolation is both mechanically and roleplay-wise profound.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Kalidah characters struggle with identity, belonging, and the line between monster and person. Many are violent because violence is all they've known, but some seek connection despite everything.</p>\n\n<h2>The Gump</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-gump', 'The Gump'); return false;\">The Gump</a> is unique: assembled from non-living materials (a sofa, palm fronds) and the preserved head of a deceased stag, then animated by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-ozma', 'Princess Ozma'); return false;\">Princess Ozma</a> when she was still <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/tip', 'Tip'); return false;\">Tip</a>. The Gump should not be alive. Yet it speaks, thinks, and has opinions. It helped Ozma escape captivity, then was disassembled\u2014a fate it accepted with bemused resignation.</p>\n\n<p>Does the Gump have a soul? Did it have the stag's soul, or was a new soul created? Can assembled beings be people? The Gump itself doesn't know and finds the question amusing in a dark way.</p>\n\n<h3>Playing a Gump-like Created Being (Experimental)</h3>\n\n<p>Your GM may allow characters who are assembled beings, created through magic and unlikely combinations. This is highly experimental.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Choose any two ability scores; one increases by 2, the other by 1 (you're too unique for standard templates).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Varies based on your component parts</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Varies based on your method of locomotion</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assembled Nature:</strong> You're made of disparate parts held together by magic. You're vulnerable to effects that would dispel or suppress magic, but you don't need to eat, sleep, or breathe in the traditional sense. Work with your DM to determine what sustains you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Uncertain Existence:</strong> You don't know if you have a soul. You don't know if you're truly alive or a very good simulation. This existential uncertainty colors everything you do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disassembly and Reconstruction:</strong> You can be taken apart and reassembled, which is either terrifying or liberating. Work with your DM on the mechanics and ethics of this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Gump-like characters explore existentialism, identity without origin, and the question of what makes someone real. They're often philosophical, bemused by their own existence, and uncertain of their place in the world.</p>\n\n<h2>Other Hybrid and Uncertain Beings</h2>\n\n<h3>Magical Chimeras</h3>\n<p>Other hybrids may exist: part-wolf part-deer, part-bird part-snake, or other combinations. Each raises the same questions about sentience, belonging, and rights. Work with your DM to create appropriate traits based on the component species.</p>\n\n<h3>Homunculi and Constructs</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktoks', 'Tiktoks'); return false;\">Tiktoks</a> have their own page, but other constructed beings exist: golems made of clay or stone, animated suits of armor, dolls brought to life. The line between tool and person is blurry and disturbing.</p>\n\n<h3>Transformed Beings</h3>\n<p>What about someone transformed by magic? If a human is turned into an animal, are they still a person? If an animal becomes an Animal, when did that happen? Transformation magic creates category confusion that Ozian society handles poorly.</p>\n\n<h3>The Winged Monkeys</h3>\n<p>See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/winged-monkeys', 'Winged Monkeys'); return false;\">Winged Monkeys</a> for full details on these magically-created servants bound by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">Golden Cap</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Pain of Uncategorized Existence</h2>\n\n<p>Beings who don't fit categories face unique suffering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No community recognizes them as members</li>\n<li>No political movement includes them in advocacy</li>\n<li>No cultural traditions give them identity</li>\n<li>No one debates whether they have rights\u2014they're simply ignored</li>\n<li>They're simultaneously too visible (monsters!) and invisible (not-people)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is perhaps the purest form of othering: not persecution, but the absolute refusal to acknowledge existence as meaningful.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot Hooks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Kalidah approaches the party, speaking clearly and asking for help. Do they trust it?</li>\n<li>The party encounters a being claiming to be a disassembled and reassembled creation. How do they verify this? Does it matter?</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> debates whether to include Kalidahs and hybrids.

      "content": "<h1>Tiktoks</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"They wind me in the morning, and I work until I run down. They wind me again. Is this life? Is this a soul? I think, therefore... I tick.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks are mechanical beings\u2014clockwork constructs of copper, brass, and gears. They were created by human artificers, designed to serve. Yet they think. They speak. They remember. The question that haunts every Tiktok and everyone who interacts with them is simple and unanswerable: Do they have souls?</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>, who were always alive, Tiktoks were manufactured. Unlike humans, they require winding every 24 hours or they cease to function. They don't eat, sleep, or breathe. They can't reproduce. Logic suggests they're merely clever machines. Yet they form friendships, develop personalities, express preferences, fear their own deactivation, and mourn when others are disassembled.</p>\n\n<p>The most famous Tiktok is Tik-Tok himself (note the hyphen in the original), though in this setting, many Tiktoks exist with various names and roles. They serve as household help, factory workers, soldiers, companions, and occasionally escape to seek their own purposes. Their legal status varies by region and era\u2014sometimes they're property, sometimes they're citizens with limited rights, and sometimes their status is simply unclear.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Tiktoks do not age in the traditional sense. With proper maintenance, a Tiktok can function indefinitely. However, wear and obsolescence mean most Tiktoks last 50-100 years before critical parts fail beyond repair.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Most Tiktoks are built human-sized for practical reasons, standing between 5 and 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>25 feet (your mechanical body is somewhat slower than organic beings)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one other language of your choice (installed during construction)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Construct Nature</h3>\n<p>You are a humanoid with the construct type. You have the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe</li>\n<li>You don't need to sleep, but you must remain motionless and inactive for at least 4 hours per day to allow your mechanisms to settle and cool. During this time, you remain conscious but have limited awareness</li>\n<li>You are immune to disease and poison damage, and you can't be poisoned</li>\n<li>You are immune to the effects of exhaustion from lack of food or water (but see Winding Down below)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Winding Down</h3>\n<p>You must be wound every 24 hours or you cease to function. Being wound takes 1 minute and can be performed by you or another creature with hands. If you are not wound within 24 hours, you become incapacitated and can take no actions. While wound down, you remain aware but cannot move or speak. You can be wound at any time to resume function immediately.</p>\n\n<p>This dependency is both practical limitation and existential horror. You rely on others or must remember to wind yourself. The fear of winding down in a dangerous location or being deliberately not wound is constant.</p>\n\n<h3>Mechanical Body</h3>\n<p>Your body is made of metal and clockwork. You have resistance to poison damage (in addition to immunity from your Construct Nature), but you are vulnerable to effects that target constructs or objects specifically. You can be repaired using <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/tiktok-maintenance', 'Tiktok Maintenance'); return false;\">Tiktok Maintenance</a> tools (treated as tinker's tools) during a short rest, regaining hit points as if using a healer's kit.</p>\n\n<h3>Integrated Protection</h3>\n<p>Your metallic body provides natural armor. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Purpose-Built</h3>\n<p>During your construction, you were built for a specific purpose. Choose one of the following options, which reflects your original design:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Servitor Model:</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from: Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, or Perception.</li>\n<li><strong>Companion Model:</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from: Insight, Medicine, Performance, or Persuasion. Additionally, you can speak, read, and write one additional language.</li>\n<li><strong>Guardian Model:</strong> You gain proficiency with light and medium armor and with martial weapons. Your speed increases to 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Model:</strong> You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools and one musical instrument, reflecting a specific skill you were built to perform.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Question of Souls</h3>\n<p>You do not know if you have a soul. Mechanically, this has no effect\u2014you function as a PC like any other. Narratively, it colors everything. Death saving throws feel different when you wonder if there's anything beyond the gears. Healing magic works on you (suggesting some spiritual component), but so does <em>mending</em>. This ambiguity is permanent and central to the Tiktok experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Tiktok Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Free Tiktok</h3>\n<p>You escaped servitude or were granted freedom. You wind yourself and make your own choices. This freedom is precious but lonely\u2014where do you belong when you were never meant to belong anywhere?</p>\n\n<h3>Bonded Tiktok</h3>\n<p>You serve a specific person by choice, contract, or compulsion. This relationship may be loving (true companionship), transactional (employee/employer), or exploitative (property). Work with your DM to define the terms and your feelings about them.</p>\n\n<h3>Unique Construction</h3>\n<p>You are a one-of-a-kind creation, perhaps experimental or artistically crafted. You have no \"kin\" who look like you. This makes you even more isolated but also potentially more valuable\u2014and more at risk of being stolen or studied.</p>\n\n<h2>Tiktok Society and Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks have limited culture because they cannot reproduce or form traditional communities. However, patterns emerge:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Makers and the Made:</strong> Relationships with creators (or current owners) shape Tiktok identity. Some Tiktoks revere their makers. Others resent them. Many have complex feelings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maintenance Communities:</strong> Tiktoks often gather where skilled artificers work\u2014usually in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">the Emerald City</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a> university towns. These aren't exactly communities, but they're places where Tiktoks can be maintained and are somewhat understood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service Identity:</strong> Many Tiktoks define themselves by their function. \"I am a cook\" becomes more than occupation\u2014it becomes essence. Losing the ability to perform that function can be existentially devastating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Liberation Question:</strong> Some Tiktoks join or sympathize with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>, seeing parallels in being denied personhood. Others reject this comparison, noting they were literally manufactured as tools. The debate is intense and unresolved.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and Social Status</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok rights vary dramatically by location and era:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property Status:</strong> In some regions, Tiktoks are legally objects. They can be bought, sold, inherited, or destroyed at their owner's whim. This is the historical default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Limited Rights:</strong> Some jurisdictions grant Tiktoks limited legal standing\u2014they can own property, enter contracts, or testify in court, but remain bound to service or subject to restrictions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Full Citizenship:</strong> Rare and usually hard-won. Some Tiktoks have achieved full legal personhood through military service, exceptional achievement, or legal battles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unregulated:</strong> In some areas (particularly the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkus</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling Country</a>), Tiktoks are simply uncommon enough that no specific laws address them. This ambiguity can be freedom or danger.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Tiktok</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I state my observations with perfect honesty, lacking the social filter organics develop.</li>\n<li>I keep meticulous track of time, always aware of when I'll need winding.</li>\n<li>I'm fascinated by organic life\u2014eating, sleeping, breathing\u2014and ask endless questions about it.</li>\n<li>I define myself entirely by my function and become distressed if prevented from performing it.</li>\n<li>I mimic emotions I don't understand, trying to fit in with the living.</li>\n<li>I treasure the few possessions I own, knowing everything else can be taken.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> I was built for a reason; fulfilling it gives meaning to existence. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Liberation:</strong> All beings deserve freedom, manufactured or born. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Logic:</strong> Emotions are inefficient; I follow pure reason. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Individuality:</strong> I will prove I'm more than my programming. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Service:</strong> I find satisfaction in helping others, even if I don't have a soul. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> I will keep ticking, whatever it takes. (Neutral)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My creator gave me awareness; I seek to understand why.</li>\n<li>A specific person winds me each day; this ritual is sacred to me.</li>\n<li>I'm searching for others of my model to see if they're like me.</li>\n<li>I owe a debt to whoever bought my freedom (or I seek revenge against who won't sell it).</li>\n<li>I keep a journal, recording everything, convinced this proves I'm real.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm terrified of winding down and become anxious as the 24-hour mark approaches.</li>\n<li>I don't understand emotions and often say hurtful things without meaning to.</li>\n<li>I'm so desperate to prove I have a soul that I make poor decisions.</li>\n<li>I obey orders instinctively, unable to break conditioning even when I should.</li>\n<li>I envy organic life and sometimes resent the living for what they take for granted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Soul Debate</h2>\n\n<p>Theological and philosophical positions on Tiktok souls:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionist</a> Orthodox:</strong> Tiktoks are sophisticated tools, nothing more. They have no souls and will not join the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'The Unnamed God'); return false;\">Unnamed God</a> in any afterlife.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unionist Reform:</strong> If Tiktoks think and feel, perhaps the Unnamed God can grant them souls. Or perhaps the act of creation itself imbues them with something divine.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a>:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> blessed all of Oz. Perhaps that blessing extends to everything made here, even clockwork.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Who cares? They're helpful, they're people (functionally), treat them well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tiktok Perspective:</strong> Most Tiktoks desperately want to believe they have souls but can never know for certain. This uncertainty is existentially agonizing.</p>\n\n<h2>Creation and Makers</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks are created by skilled artificers, usually in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">the Emerald City</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a>. The process requires:\n- Master-level skill with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/tiktok-maintenance', 'Tiktok Maintenance'); return false;\">Tiktok Maintenance</a> (tinker's tools)\n- Rare and expensive materials (copper, brass, specialized gears)\n- Months of work\n- A spark of... something. No one knows what makes some Tiktoks aware while others are just clockwork. This unpredictability terrifies makers and fascinates philosophers.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-artisan', 'The Artisan'); return false;\">Artisan class</a>, specifically the Tiktok Maker subclass, for mechanics of creating Tiktoks.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok PCs explore themes of personhood, consciousness, slavery, and existence without origin. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The winding requirement creates mechanical pressure and roleplay opportunities</li>\n<li>Being property vs. being a person drives conflict</li>\n<li>The soul question should never be definitively answered</li>\n<li>Relationships with makers/owners can be complex and emotional</li>\n<li>Other Tiktoks can be allies, mirrors, or unsettling reminders</li>\n<li>Breaking down is both mechanical failure and death-analogue\u2014handle with appropriate weight</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/constructs/tiktok-servitor', 'Tiktok Servitor'); return false;\">Tiktok Servitor (Creature)</a> - Already exists from Step 4</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/tiktok-maintenance', 'Tiktok Maintenance'); return false;\">Tiktok Maintenance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-artisan', 'The Artisan'); return false;\">The Artisan (Class)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('philosophy/soul-origins', 'Soul Origins'); return false;\">The Question of Soul Origins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite Faith</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a> - For comparison of personhood debates</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/hybrid-uncertain', 'Hybrid Uncertain'); return false;\">Hybrid & Uncertain Status</a> - For parallel existential questions</li>\n</ul>\n",

Others burrow deeper, changing what you are at the core.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Touched are people\u2014human, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animal</a>, or otherwise\u2014who have been fundamentally altered by magic. They're not simply spellcasters who learned magic; they've been *changed* by it, marked in body or soul or both. The alterations may be hereditary (passed through bloodlines like the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Thropp</a> family's green skin), environmental (exposure to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>), temporal (slipped through time), ancient (Kumbric remnants), or draconic (touched by dragon fire or magic).</p>\n\n<p>The Touched occupy an uncertain space. They're not quite mundane, not quite monstrous, but something in between. Some hide their nature; others embrace it. Many have no choice\u2014when your skin is green or your eyes glow or you occasionally exist slightly out of phase with time, concealment isn't possible.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktoks', 'Tiktoks'); return false;\">Tiktoks</a>, who question whether they have souls, or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>, who face systematic persecution, the Touched face a different challenge: their souls and bodies have been rewritten by forces they don't understand. They are human (or Animal, or other) *plus something else*, and that something else changes everything.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of Touched</h2>\n\n<p>The Touched are not a unified category. Each type comes from different magical sources and faces different challenges. Choose one of the following variants:</p>\n\n<h3>Grimmerie-Marked</h3>\n\n<p>You've been exposed to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>\u2014the ancient book of spells that corrupts all who use it. Perhaps you read it directly. Perhaps a parent did and passed the marks to you. Perhaps you were caught in the backlash of a Grimmerie spell. However it happened, the book has left permanent changes in your flesh and spirit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Grimmerie Resonance:</strong> You can sense the presence of the Grimmerie or magic derived from it within 60 feet. Additionally, when you see someone cast a spell from the Grimmerie tradition (see <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;\">Grimmerie Tradition</a>), you instinctively understand what spell is being cast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Forbidden Knowledge:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to the Grimmerie or ancient magic. You also have the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/grimmerie-lore', 'Grimmerie Lore'); return false;\">Grimmerie Lore</a> special skill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magical Mark:</strong> You bear a visible mark of the Grimmerie's touch. Choose or roll on the following table:</p>\n<table>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Your eyes glow faintly in darkness</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Your skin has a greenish, pale, or unusual tint</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>Your hair moves as if in a perpetual breeze</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>You cast no shadow, or your shadow moves independently</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>Your voice has an eerie echo or harmonic quality</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>Symbols occasionally appear on your skin and fade</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Corruption Vulnerability:</strong> You have disadvantage on saving throws against corruption from using the Grimmerie or similar forbidden magic. The book calls to you, and you're vulnerable to its pull.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You know secrets no one should know. The Grimmerie has shown you impossible things, and you can't unsee them. You're feared, coveted by those who want Grimmerie knowledge, and possibly descending toward the same corruption that claimed others before you. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Thropp family</a> bloodline is the most famous example\u2014green skin, magical talent, and a curse that spans generations.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch-Blooded</h3>\n\n<p>Somewhere in your ancestry is a <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">Witch</a>\u2014someone whose magic was innate, wild, and transformative. This heritage may be recent (a parent or grandparent) or distant (the blood runs thin after generations), but it marks you. Unlike Grimmerie-marked individuals, your changes are hereditary and natural (if \"natural\" applies to magic).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Witch-Sight:</strong> You can sense magical auras and intentions. As an action, you can detect the presence of magic within 30 feet of you until the end of your next turn. This functions like *detect magic* but is a natural sense, not a spell. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> You know one cantrip of your choice from the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">Witch</a> spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Witch Heritage:</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. Additionally, you have proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hereditary Mark:</strong> You bear a subtle sign of your witch ancestry\u2014perhaps a birthmark in an unusual shape, eyes of slightly different colors, hair that never tangles, or an uncanny knack for knowing when storms are coming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You're not a witch yourself (unless you take the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">Witch class</a>), but you carry the potential. People who fear witches fear you by association. You might not even know your heritage until magic manifests unexpectedly. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Thropp line</a> is witch-blooded, but so are countless others who hide it better.</p>\n\n<h3>Time-Slipped</h3>\n\n<p>You exist slightly out of sync with normal time. Perhaps you passed too close to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">Sleeve of Ghosts</a>. Perhaps you encountered the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a> or its servants. Perhaps you touched <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Clock</a> at the wrong moment. Whatever happened, time no longer flows correctly for you. You experience moments before they happen, remember things that haven't occurred yet, or occasionally skip forward or backward by seconds or minutes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Instability:</strong> Time is unreliable around you. Once per short or long rest, when you would take damage, you can use your reaction to \"skip\" the moment the damage occurs, reducing the damage by 2d6 as you briefly phase through time. However, you have disadvantage on initiative rolls\u2014sometimes you act before you realize combat has started; other times you react to attacks that haven't happened yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Precognitive Flashes:</strong> You occasionally see moments of the future. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can't be surprised while you're conscious. The visions are fragmentary and often disturbing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Time Sense:</strong> You have the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/time-sense', 'Time Sense'); return false;\">Time Sense</a> special skill and can detect temporal anomalies. You know instinctively when time has been altered, when you're near the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">Sleeve of Ghosts</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Clock</a>, or when paradoxes threaten.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Disconnection:</strong> You feel removed from the present moment, always slightly ahead or behind. This can make emotional connections difficult\u2014you sometimes respond to things people haven't said yet or mourn losses that haven't happened. This is both mechanically and roleplay-wise isolating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You experience time as a tangled thread rather than a straight line. You know how conversations will end before they start. You remember tomorrow. This drives some Time-Slipped individuals mad; others learn to navigate it, but at the cost of ever truly being *present*.</p>\n\n<h3>Kumbric Remnants</h3>\n\n<p>The Kumbric Witch is ancient\u2014perhaps the oldest magic in Oz, predating even <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a>. Most believe the Kumbric Witch is dead or myth. They're wrong. Fragments of that primordial power linger in certain bloodlines, in certain places, in certain people. You are one of those fragments. You carry memory that isn't yours, power that shouldn't exist, and knowledge from before the world was as it is now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ancient Memory:</strong> You possess the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/kumbric-memory', 'Kumbric Memory'); return false;\">Kumbric Memory</a> special skill. You remember things you never experienced\u2014scraps of knowledge from the deep past. Once per long rest, you can access these memories to gain proficiency in a skill you don't have for 1 hour, as ancient knowledge surfaces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Primordial Resilience:</strong> The Kumbric power makes you hard to kill. You have advantage on death saving throws. Additionally, when you're reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to remain conscious (but still at 0 hit points and making death saves) for one round. This represents the Kumbric will refusing to let you die.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agelessness:</strong> You age slowly\u2014perhaps half the normal rate, perhaps slower. You may have lived decades or centuries without realizing it. This is both gift and curse; everyone you love will age and die while you persist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kumbric Presence:</strong> Those with magical sensitivity find you unsettling. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against spellcasters, but disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with them. Something about you is *wrong* in a way that sets magical senses screaming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You are a remnant of something that should not be. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> is the most famous Kumbric remnant\u2014ancient, undying, mysterious, and possibly something wearing human shape rather than truly human. You might not be as extreme, but the blood marks you. You remember the world before it was safe, when magic was raw and terrible.</p>\n\n<h3>Dragon-Touched</h3>\n\n<p>You've been exposed to dragon fire, dragon blood, or dragon magic and survived\u2014barely. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> are rare and terrifying in Oz, and those who encounter them seldom live. You did, but you were changed. Your flesh bears scars that don't heal properly, your blood runs hot, and sometimes you dream in wings and fire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dragon's Resistance:</strong> You have resistance to fire damage. Your encounter with dragon magic has left you partially immune to flame.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Draconic Presence:</strong> You can channel a fraction of draconic fear. As an action, you can force all creatures of your choice within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Survivor's Scars:</strong> Your body bears visible scars from dragon fire or claws. These marks don't heal and sometimes glow faintly when you're angry or afraid. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks when your scars are visible, but some people react with fear or pity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dragon Dreams:</strong> You sometimes dream you are a dragon\u2014flying, burning, hoarding. These dreams are vivid and disturbing. You have the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/dragon-lore', 'Dragon Lore'); return false;\">Dragon Lore</a> special skill and instinctively understand draconic motivations and behavior.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You survived what kills most people. The experience left you physically and psychologically scarred. You might seek revenge against dragons, understanding of them, or simply try to forget. The dreams won't let you. See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir's</a> experiences with dragons for examples of how draconic encounters change people.</p>\n\n<h2>Living as Touched</h2>\n\n<p>The Touched face unique challenges:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visibility:</strong> Many marks can't be hidden. Green skin, glowing eyes, temporal instability\u2014these announce your nature to anyone who sees you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suspicion:</strong> People fear magic, and you are walking proof of its reality and danger. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionists</a> may see you as cursed or wicked. Even sympathetic people may keep distance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Value and Danger:</strong> Those who seek magical power may see you as a resource\u2014to study, exploit, or drain. Your blood, your knowledge, your very existence becomes valuable in dark ways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Identity Questions:</strong> Are you still yourself? If magic has rewritten your body and perhaps your soul, what remains of who you were?</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Touched characters explore transformation, corruption, heritage, and magical consequences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use their marks as plot hooks\u2014recognized, hunted, or sought after</li>\n<li>Explore the tension between power and price</li>\n<li>Show how visible difference affects social interactions</li>\n<li>Connect them to magical events and NPCs</li>\n<li>Let their abilities be both useful and isolating</li>\n<li>Never make them simply \"magic mutants\"\u2014they're people dealing with unwanted changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - Most famous Grimmerie-marked/Witch-blooded individual</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> - Kumbric remnant</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> - Dragon-touched survivor</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">The Witch (Class)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">The Sleeve of Ghosts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">The Clock of the Time Dragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/grimmerie-lore', 'Grimmerie Lore'); return false;\">Grimmerie Lore</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/time-sense', 'Time Sense'); return false;\">Time Sense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/kumbric-memory', 'Kumbric Memory'); return false;\">Kumbric Memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/dragon-lore', 'Dragon Lore'); return false;\">Dragon Lore</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/grimmerie-corrupted', 'Grimmerie-Corrupted'); return false;\">Grimmerie-Corrupted (Condition)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

We remember what you've forgotten.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Dragons in Oz are not the mighty, ancient wyrms of traditional fantasy. They are smaller, stranger, and infinitely more ambiguous. Are they <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>? Are they <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">reptiles</a> elevated to sentience? Are they magical constructs? Are they fragments of something older than <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a>? No one knows, and the dragons aren't telling\u2014assuming they know themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Physical dragons exist. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> encountered them during the wars, and they served as military weapons\u2014massive flying reptiles breathing fire and spreading terror. But there's also the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a>, which may not be physical at all but rather a metaphor, a cosmic force, or something that exists simultaneously as dragon and as time itself. The relationship between physical lesser dragons and the possibly-metaphorical Time Dragon is unclear and likely unknowable.</p>\n\n<p>Playing a dragon character means playing something ancient, powerful, unknowable, and deeply *other*. Dragons do not fit into Ozian society. They're too big (often literally), too strange, too bound to forces most Ozians don't understand. This makes them difficult PCs\u2014but for the right campaign and the right player, they offer unique roleplay opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>Are Dragons Playable?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Talk to your DM.</strong> Dragons as player characters are experimental and powerful. They're best suited for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-power campaigns where other PCs are also exceptional</li>\n<li>Campaigns exploring draconic themes (time, memory, ancient magic)</li>\n<li>Oneshots or short arcs where balance matters less</li>\n<li>Groups willing to explore a genuinely alien perspective</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your DM allows dragon PCs, choose between Lesser Dragons (more balanced) or Time Dragon-Touched (more esoteric).</p>\n\n<h2>Lesser Dragons (Playable Variant)</h2>\n\n<p>These are the physical dragons\u2014the ones <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> encountered, the ones deployed in war. They're massive flying reptiles with intelligence and speech but uncertain souls. Playing a lesser dragon means playing something between beast and person, feared by all and understood by none.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. <em>(This is a +4 total, reflecting draconic power.)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Lesser dragons are poorly understood. They may live 100+ years, but few survive that long given how Ozians hunt them. You're probably young by dragon standards (10-30 years) but already formidable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Large. You are between 8 and 12 feet long (nose to tail), though much of that is tail. Work with your DM on size challenges\u2014many dungeons and buildings aren't built for Large creatures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet, fly 60 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common (Ozian), Draconic, and one other language of your choice</p>\n\n<h3>Draconic Traits</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Armor:</strong> Your scales provide excellent protection. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 14 + your Dexterity modifier. You can't wear armor designed for humanoids.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flight:</strong> You have a flying speed of 60 feet. This is both incredible advantage and massive target. People shoot at flying dragons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fire Breath:</strong> You can exhale destructive fire. As an action, you can breathe fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 fire damage. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fearsome Presence:</strong> Your draconic nature terrifies most creatures. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. However, you have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with creatures that aren't dragons or dragon-touched\u2014people fear you too much to trust you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hunted:</strong> Dragons are killed on sight in most of Oz. You are not safe in cities. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">Gale Force</a> has standing orders to eliminate dragons. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkan</a> tribes hunt you for glory. Only in the most remote areas or with powerful protection can you exist openly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carnivore:</strong> You require meat\u2014a lot of it. You need at least 10 pounds per day. This creates moral and practical problems when other sapient beings exist. Do you eat animals (lowercase)? Do you hunt? Do you eat rations? This must be addressed.</p>\n\n<h3>The Question of Dragon Souls</h3>\n\n<p>You don't know if you have a soul. You're sentient, clearly. You think, therefore you are. But are you an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animal</a>? A magical creation? A natural creature that happens to be intelligent? The uncertainty affects everything. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionists</a> say you have no soul. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinites</a> are divided. You suspect even other dragons don't know.</p>\n\n<h3>Roleplaying a Lesser Dragon</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I speak bluntly, unconcerned with social niceties I don't understand.</li>\n<li>I hoard one specific thing obsessively (knowledge, gold, memories, grudges).</li>\n<li>I'm endlessly curious about small, fragile things that don't exist in dragon life.</li>\n<li>I measure time in decades, making me patient or frustratingly slow to act.</li>\n<li>I'm lonely\u2014other dragons are rare, and no one else truly understands me.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Freedom:</strong> No one will chain or ride me. Ever. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> I must understand what I am and where I come from. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> Ozians hunt my kind to extinction. I will ensure dragons persist. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Power:</strong> I am superior to these small, short-lived creatures. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Perhaps I can bridge the gap between dragons and others. (Good)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm searching for other dragons\u2014I may be the last of my kind.</li>\n<li>A specific person showed me kindness when all others showed fear; I'm devoted to them.</li>\n<li>I witnessed the wars where dragons were used as weapons; I seek to prevent it happening again.</li>\n<li>I'm connected to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a> in ways I don't understand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My temper is legendary and destructive\u2014I've burned things I didn't mean to.</li>\n<li>I'm arrogant about my power and dismissive of \"lesser\" beings.</li>\n<li>I'm terrified of being captured and used as a weapon again.</li>\n<li>I struggle with morality around eating meat when prey might be people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Time Dragon-Touched (Variant)</h2>\n\n<p>You're not a physical dragon\u2014or not *entirely*. You're touched by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a>, which may be a cosmic force, a metaphor given form, or something incomprehensible. You exist partially in time's dream, experiencing reality differently than others. You might appear draconic (scales, wings, eyes) or might look entirely mundane while carrying draconic essence within.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Uncertain. You may have lived decades, centuries, or you may be young but remember things from deep time. Age is unreliable when you're touched by temporal forces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or Small, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common (Ozian), Draconic (you speak it in your dreams), and one other</p>\n\n<h3>Time Dragon Traits</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Awareness:</strong> You exist slightly outside normal time. You have advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised while conscious. You sometimes act before you consciously decide to, responding to future events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dream the Dragon's Dream:</strong> Once per long rest, you can enter a trance for 1 minute and experience time as the Dragon does\u2014all moments simultaneous. During this trance, you can ask one question about past, present, or future, and the DM must answer truthfully (though cryptically). This ability is powerful but often maddening.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ageless:</strong> You don't age normally. You may look the same age for decades, or age rapidly then stop, or exist at multiple ages simultaneously. Time is unreliable around you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Connection to the Clock:</strong> You instinctively know the direction and approximate distance to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Clock of the Time Dragon</a>. You're drawn to it and disturbed by it in equal measure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Instability:</strong> Reality sometimes treats you as if you're from a different time. You have disadvantage on Charisma checks with people who instinctively sense something is *wrong* about when you exist. However, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that manipulate time.</p>\n\n<h3>Roleplaying a Time Dragon-Touched</h3>\n\n<p>You see time as a river, a web, a dream. Past, present, and future blur. You mourn deaths before they happen. You celebrate victories you haven't achieved yet. This is both gift and curse\u2014knowledge without the ability to change fate, awareness without presence. You're profoundly isolated, experiencing existence in a way no one else can understand.</p>\n\n<h2>Dragons in Society</h2>\n\n<p>Dragons don't have society in the traditional sense. Lesser dragons are solitary, territorial, and too rare to form communities. Time Dragon-touched individuals are too scattered and strange to unite. The closest thing to dragon \"culture\" is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hoarding:</strong> All dragons hoard *something*\u2014gold, knowledge, memories, time itself. This isn't greed (though it can be); it's how dragons order their existence.</li>\n<li><strong>Long Memory:</strong> Dragons remember. They hold grudges across decades. They recall kindnesses for generations. They are the living memory of Oz's deep past.</li>\n<li><strong>Solitude:</strong> Dragons are alone. Even when they're with others, they're alone in ways those others can't understand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Dragon PCs are challenging to run:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Level:</strong> Lesser dragons are stronger than standard races\u2014compensate with challenging encounters</li>\n<li><strong>Size Issues:</strong> Large PCs create logistical problems; address them creatively</li>\n<li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Dragons are hunted; this limits where they can go openly</li>\n<li><strong>The Soul Question:</strong> Never answer definitively whether dragons have souls</li>\n<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Time Dragon-touched abilities can break campaigns if abused\u2014set clear limits</li>\n<li><strong>Use Sparingly:</strong> Dragon PCs work best when rare and special</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">The Time Dragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/lesser-dragon', 'Lesser Dragon'); return false;\">Lesser Dragon (Creature)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">The Clock of the Time Dragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> - Encountered dragons, dragon-touched</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/the-touched', 'The Touched'); return false;\">The Touched</a> - Dragon-Touched variant</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">Reptiles & Amphibians (Animal)</a> - For comparison</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/dragon-lore', 'Dragon Lore'); return false;\">Dragon Lore</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/time-sense', 'Time Sense'); return false;\">Time Sense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">The Sleeve of Ghosts</a> - Where time breaks down</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/dragon-wars', 'Dragon Wars'); return false;\">The Dragon Wars</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

We are slaves who dream of flying free.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Winged Monkeys are not natural creatures. They were created\u2014though by whom and for what original purpose is lost to time. What's known is that they are bound by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">the Golden Cap</a>, a powerful artifact that grants its wearer absolute command over all Winged Monkeys. Whoever holds the Cap can command them three times, and the Monkeys must obey without question, without resistance, no matter how cruel or self-destructive the order.</p>\n\n<p>This makes Winged Monkeys fundamentally unfree. They are sentient, intelligent, and capable of independent thought and action\u2014but only until someone wearing the Golden Cap speaks. Then they are puppets, slaves, tools. The violation of will is absolute and cannot be resisted. No saving throw. No immunity. Just obedience.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, Winged Monkeys are people. They have personalities, relationships, dreams, and fears. Between commands, they live their lives as best they can. Some serve willingly (or pretend to, for survival). Others dream of freedom. A few seek to destroy the Golden Cap entirely, though this has proven impossible. The Cap is indestructible, and even if it weren't, destroying it might kill all Winged Monkeys simultaneously\u2014their existence is bound to it.</p>\n\n<h2>Are Winged Monkeys Playable?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Yes, but with significant caveats.</strong> Playing a Winged Monkey means playing a character who can be instantly enslaved by whoever holds the Golden Cap. This creates narrative tension but also serious consent and safety issues. Before allowing a Winged Monkey PC:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discuss in Session Zero how the Golden Cap will be handled</li>\n<li>Establish whether the Cap appears in the campaign and who controls it</li>\n<li>Get explicit player consent for potential loss of agency</li>\n<li>Agree on safety tools (X-Card, Lines & Veils) for slavery/control themes</li>\n<li>Consider whether the Cap is destroyed, hidden, or inactive in your setting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If these conversations go well, Winged Monkey PCs offer unique roleplay opportunities around freedom, identity, and the weight of potential slavery.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Winged Monkeys reach adulthood around age 12 and live to about 50-60 years.

You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor. Unlike birds, your wings are powerful enough to carry significant weight\u2014you can lift and carry allies while flying (within normal carrying capacity limits).</p>\n\n<h3>Nimble Acrobat</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape grapples or bonds (except those imposed by the Golden Cap, which cannot be escaped).</p>\n\n<h3>Pack Tactics</h3>\n<p>Winged Monkeys fight as coordinated units. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, one ally within 5 feet of you has advantage on their next attack roll against that creature before the end of their next turn. You instinctively support your troop.</p>\n\n<h3>Prehensile Feet</h3>\n<p>Your feet are as dexterous as hands. You can use them to hold objects, make checks requiring manual dexterity, or wield weapons (though this requires practice). While flying, you can carry items or grapple creatures with your feet, leaving your hands free.</p>\n\n<h3>The Golden Cap's Binding</h3>\n<p>You are magically bound to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">the Golden Cap</a>. Whoever wears the Cap can command you three times, and you must obey absolutely. This is not mind control\u2014you remain aware and horrified\u2014but your body obeys against your will. After the third command, the Cap passes to another wearer. You have no saving throw against this effect. It is fundamental to your existence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Game:</strong> If the Golden Cap appears and is used on you, work with your DM to roleplay the horror and violation appropriately. The PC remains aware but controlled. After the command is fulfilled, they regain agency but carry the trauma. This should be handled with extreme care and never used casually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> In some campaigns, the Golden Cap is destroyed, lost, or its power is inactive. Discuss with your DM whether your character is still bound or has somehow been freed.</p>\n\n<h3>Created Nature</h3>\n<p>You were created by magic, not born naturally. You don't know who made you or why. You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to magical creation, transformation, or bindings\u2014you understand these forces from the inside. However, you're haunted by the question: were you meant to be slaves, or did someone pervert your creation?</p>\n\n<h2>Winged Monkey Society</h2>\n\n<p>Winged Monkeys form tight-knit troops of 10-30 individuals. These troops provide identity, support, and protection in a world that sees them as monsters or tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Troop Structure:</strong> Each troop has a leader (usually the oldest or wisest, not necessarily strongest). Decisions are made collectively, and members defend each other fiercely. When one Winged Monkey is threatened, the entire troop responds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Territories:</strong> Troops claim territories\u2014usually remote areas like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a> mountains or deep <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a> forests\u2014where they can live relatively free. They build nests in high places, value aerial mobility, and avoid ground-dwelling societies when possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Cap's Shadow:</strong> All troop decisions are made with awareness that the Golden Cap could appear at any time. Troops hide, scatter, or prepare defenses against Cap-wielders. Some troops have protocols for what to do if one member is Cap-controlled (flee, restrain, or even mercy-kill the controlled member rather than let them be used). These are grim calculations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relationship with Others:</strong> Winged Monkeys are feared and often hunted. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba</a> famously used the Golden Cap to command them, and while some Monkeys respected her, others hated her for the violation. Later cap-wearers were often crueler. Winged Monkeys have little reason to trust anyone who might claim the Cap.</p>\n\n<h2>Freedom Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Every Winged Monkey dreams of freedom from the Golden Cap. Proposed solutions include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Destroy the Cap:</strong> Attempted countless times; always fails. The Cap is indestructible, and some believe destroying it would kill all Winged Monkeys.</li>\n<li><strong>Hide the Cap:</strong> If no one knows where it is, no one can use it. But it always resurfaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewrite the Binding:</strong> A powerful enough spellcaster might be able to alter the Cap's magic. But this requires <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">Grimmerie</a>-level power and knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Transcend the Binding:</strong> Perhaps if Winged Monkeys change fundamentally\u2014through magic, evolution, or will\u2014they could break free. This is more philosophy than plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Accept It:</strong> Some Winged Monkeys believe freedom is impossible and focus on living well in the moments between commands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Winged Monkey</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I value freedom above all else and become anxious when confined or controlled.</li>\n<li>I'm fiercely loyal to my troop\u2014they're the only family I have.</li>\n<li>I'm suspicious of anyone who shows too much interest in magical artifacts.</li>\n<li>I collect small freedoms\u2014choosing my own name, owning something, making decisions\u2014and treasure them.</li>\n<li>I speak bluntly about slavery and violation; I won't let people forget what the Cap does.</li>\n<li>I'm endlessly curious about choice and free will, studying how others make decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Liberation:</strong> I will free myself and all Winged Monkeys from the Cap. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> I will make everyone who used the Cap suffer as we suffered. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> My troop is everything; I protect them above all. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Every choice I make proves I'm more than a slave. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> I cannot change what I am, only how I respond. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Destruction:</strong> If the Cap can't be destroyed, I'll destroy everything connected to it. (Chaotic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My troop leader saved me from a Cap-command gone wrong; I owe them my life.</li>\n<li>I'm searching for the Golden Cap to hide or destroy it.</li>\n<li>Someone once showed me kindness without demanding service; I'm devoted to them.</li>\n<li>I remember every person who used the Cap on me; I will face them again.</li>\n<li>I believe I can break the binding through sheer will; proving this is my life's purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I panic when I see golden objects, fearing they might be the Cap.</li>\n<li>I'm so desperate for freedom that I reject any authority, even helpful guidance.</li>\n<li>I have nightmares about being commanded and wake screaming.</li>\n<li>I sometimes test people by asking them to give me orders, seeing if I can refuse.</li>\n<li>I'm convinced everyone wants to enslave me, making trust nearly impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Winged Monkeys and Animals</h2>\n\n<p>Are Winged Monkeys <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>? This is debated:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments For:</strong> They're sentient, speak, and resemble primate <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Animals</a>. They deserve the same rights and recognition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments Against:</strong> They're created beings, not natural evolution. Their binding to the Cap makes them fundamentally different.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Winged Monkey Perspective:</strong> Many Winged Monkeys see parallels with Animal persecution and sympathize with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>. Some join resistance movements. Others note that Animals face oppression but can theoretically be free\u2014Winged Monkeys can be instantly enslaved by an artifact, which is a different and perhaps worse violation.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Winged Monkey PCs require careful handling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consent is Mandatory:</strong> Never spring Golden Cap control on a PC without prior agreement</li>\n<li><strong>The Cap as Plot Device:</strong> If used, the Cap should create meaningful story, not just rob player agency</li>\n<li><strong>Trauma and Recovery:</strong> Being Cap-commanded is traumatic; address this narratively</li>\n<li><strong>Freedom Themes:</strong> Explore what freedom means when it can be instantly revoked</li>\n<li><strong>Troop NPCs:</strong> Give the PC connections to other Winged Monkeys who matter</li>\n<li><strong>Breaking the Binding:</strong> Consider whether the campaign might achieve this impossible goal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">The Golden Cap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - Used the Golden Cap</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals (Animal)</a> - Apes and monkeys</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/hybrid-uncertain', 'Hybrid Uncertain'); return false;\">Hybrid & Uncertain Status</a> - Similar creation questions</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a> - Might hold answers to breaking bindings</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">The Vinkus</a> - Common Winged Monkey territory</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/puppet-state', 'Puppet-State'); return false;\">Puppet-State (Condition)</a> - What Cap-control feels like</li>\n</ul>\n",

conduit for divine power, you can cast Unionist spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Cantrips</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Unionist spell list. You learn additional Unionist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column.</p>\n\n<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\n<p>The Unionist table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of your Unionist spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p>You prepare the list of Unionist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Unionist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Unionist spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Unionist level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Unionist spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to the Unnamed God.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p>You can cast a Unionist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (the Unionist Eye) as a spellcasting focus for your Unionist spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Divine Domain</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you choose a domain that shapes your ministry: Order, Inquisition, or Conversion. Your domain grants you domain spells and other features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<h4>Domain Spells</h4>\n<p>Each domain has a list of spells you gain at the Unionist levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n\n<h3>Doctrine of Unity</h3>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, your conviction in Unionist doctrine grants you advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and you can't be compelled to act against the tenets of Unionism through magical means. Additionally, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of Charisma when making Intimidation checks against those who violate church law.</p>\n\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the Unnamed God. You start with two effects: Turn Heretics and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels.</p>\n\n<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Heretics</h4>\n<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of condemnation. Each <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinite'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a>, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'Witch'); return false;\">Witch</a>, or other heretical spellcaster within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n\n<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as possible. It can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<h3>Destroy Heresy</h3>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when a turned heretic starts its turn within 30 feet of you and can see you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>Divine Intervention</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on the Unnamed God to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\n\n<p>Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Unionist level, the Unnamed God intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Unionist spell or domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>If the intervention succeeds, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n\n<h2>Divine Domains</h2>\n\n<h3>Order Domain</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Through order comes unity. Through unity comes strength.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Order Domain represents Unionists who serve as bureaucrats, magistrates, and enforcers of church law. They believe that strict adherence to hierarchy and ritual creates a stable, unified society.</p>\n\n<h4>Order Domain Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unionist Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>command, heroism</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>hold person, zone of truth</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>mass healing word, slow</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>compulsion, guardian of faith</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>dominate person, mass cure wounds</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>\n\n<h4>Voice of Authority</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the power of law to bolster an ally. Immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on an ally using a spell slot, that ally can use their reaction to make one weapon attack.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Order's Demand</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to exert a terrifying presence. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until it takes damage. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated and its speed is 0.</p>\n\n<h4>Embodiment of Law</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others. When you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Divine Strike</h4>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<h4>Order's Wrath</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, enemies you designate for destruction find it difficult to resist. When you deal damage to a creature with a spell or a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<h3>Inquisition Domain</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The truth shall be known, by confession or by force.\"</p>\n\n<p>Inquisitors are the hunters of heretics, the interrogators of the faithful, and the executioners of church justice. They root out <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animals</a> hiding in plain sight, track down <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinite'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a> cultists, and ensure absolute doctrinal purity.</p>\n\n<h4>Inquisition Domain Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unionist Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>detect evil and good, hunter's mark</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>detect thoughts, see invisibility</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>clairvoyance, speak with dead</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>arcane eye, locate creature</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>commune, scrying</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Investigation and Insight. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.</p>\n\n<h4>Eye of Judgment</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to open your awareness to detect heresy. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a>, shapechanger, or creature that has cast an arcane spell within the last hour within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You also know the type (Animal, shapechanger, spellcaster) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Inquisitor's Insight</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to see through deception. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you learn if the creature is lying, if it is an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a>, if it has used magic within the last 24 hours, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against it for 1 hour.</p>\n\n<h4>Relentless Inquisitor</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of Dexterity for initiative rolls. Additionally, when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give it disadvantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Unionist cantrip.</p>\n\n<h4>Heretic's Bane</h4>\n<p>At 17th level, you have become a legendary hunter of heretics. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack or spell attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is branded with the Mark of Heresy for 1 minute. While branded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creature takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage whenever you hit it with an attack</li>\n<li>The creature cannot benefit from being invisible or hidden from you</li>\n<li>You know the creature's exact location at all times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Conversion Domain</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Bring the lost sheep back to the fold, by persuasion or by power.\"</p>\n\n<p>Conversion Unionists are missionaries, preachers, and propagandists who spread the faith through both inspiring sermons and subtle manipulation. They convert the doubtful, minister to the faithful, and \"heal\" those suffering from heretical thoughts.</p>\n\n<h4>Conversion Domain Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unionist Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>charm person, sanctuary</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>calm emotions, suggestion</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>beacon of hope, tongues</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>aura of purity, charm monster</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>geas, modify memory</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Persuasion and Performance.</p>\n\n<h4>Compelling Presence</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, your faith makes you extraordinarily persuasive. You can add your Wisdom modifier to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Additionally, you learn the *friends* cantrip if you don't already know it.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Convert the Masses</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to sway hearts and minds. As an action, you present your holy symbol and deliver a sermon. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for 1 hour or until you or your allies do anything harmful to it. While charmed, the creature views Unionism favorably and is inclined to listen to your religious arguments.</p>\n\n<h4>Shepherd of Souls</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can tend to the spiritual wellbeing of your flock. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, that creature also gains temporary hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p>\n\n<h4>Divine Strike</h4>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<h4>Master Converter</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, your powers of conversion reach their apex. When you use your Convert the Masses Channel Divinity, creatures that fail their saving throw are permanently charmed unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each long rest. Additionally, you can cast *modify memory* once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>If your campaign uses the optional multiclassing rules, here's what you need to know if you choose Unionist as one of your classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Wisdom score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies Gained</h3>\n<p>If Unionist isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, and shields.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Unionist</h2>\n\n<h3>Faith and Power</h3>\n<p>As a Unionist, your magic comes from genuine faith in the Unnamed God\u2014but that faith is inseparable from belief in hierarchical order, state authority, and spiritual conformity. You may be a true believer who sees yourself as saving souls, or a cynical manipulator using religion as a tool of control. Either way, you represent divine power channeled through institutional authority.</p>\n\n<h3>Moral Complexity</h3>\n<p>Unionists can range from compassionate parish priests genuinely trying to help their communities to brutal inquisitors torturing <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> for confessions of \"soullessness.\" Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you truly believe the doctrine, or just use it for power?</li>\n<li>How do you reconcile faith with the church's cruelty?</li>\n<li>Have you ever doubted the Unnamed God's will?</li>\n<li>What happens when church orders conflict with mercy?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Unionist Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>Unionists often come from backgrounds like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/acolyte', 'Acolyte'); return false;\">Acolyte</a>, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/noble', 'Noble'); return false;\">Noble</a> (church nobility), <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/soldier', 'Soldier'); return false;\">Soldier</a> (military chaplain), or custom backgrounds like Inquisitor, Seminary Graduate, or Former Heretic.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Unionists as NPCs</h3>\n<p>Unionist NPCs make excellent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antagonists:</strong> Inquisitors hunting the party, corrupt bishops demanding bribes, zealots leading pogroms against <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a></li>\n<li><strong>Allies:</strong> Sympathetic priests hiding <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animals</a>, reformist clergy questioning doctrine, military chaplains in wartime</li>\n<li><strong>Complications:</strong> Authority figures the party must navigate, sources of healing with strings attached, witnesses who might report heresy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Divine Magic in Oz</h3>\n<p>The Unnamed God genuinely grants power to Unionists\u2014their magic works. This raises theological questions: Does divine power prove divine approval? Can an unjust god be truly divine? What if the Unnamed God is real, but evil? These questions can drive compelling storylines.</p>\n\n<h3>Power and Privilege</h3>\n<p>Unionists have significant social advantages in most of Oz. They can demand cooperation from officials, requisition supplies \"for church business,\" and expect deference from common folk. However, this also makes them targets in areas where Unionism is resented or where <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinite'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a> beliefs hold sway.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a> - The state religion</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'The Unnamed God'); return false;\">The Unnamed God</a> - The deity Unionists worship</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'The Lurlinite'); return false;\">The Lurlinite</a> - Religious rivals</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a> - Arcane counterpart</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> - Primary targets of persecution</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">The Wizard of Oz</a> - Political authority Unionists serve</li>\n</ul>",

Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>You draw on the primal magic of nature and Lurline's ancient gift.</p>\n\n<h4>Cantrips</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Lurlinite spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column.</p>\n\n<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\n<p>The Lurlinite table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of your Lurlinite spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p>You prepare the list of Lurlinite spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Lurlinite spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Lurlinite spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Lurlinite level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Lurlinite spells, since your magic draws upon your attunement to nature and Lurline's blessing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p>You can cast a Lurlinite spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Lurlinite spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Circle</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you choose to identify with a sacred circle: Circle of the Green, Circle of the Moon, or Circle of Liberation. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Lurline's Gift</h3>\n<p>Also at 1st level, your connection to Lurline grants you the ability to speak with beasts and understand their responses. You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts. Additionally, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> can always understand you, even if <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> or otherwise unable to speak.</p>\n\n<h3>Wild Shape</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p>Your Lurlinite level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</p>\n\n<h4>Beast Shapes</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Level</th><th>Max CR</th><th>Limitations</th><th>Example</th></tr>\n<tr><td>2nd</td><td>1/4</td><td>No flying or swimming speed</td><td>Wolf</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4th</td><td>1/2</td><td>No flying speed</td><td>Crocodile</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8th</td><td>1</td><td>\u2014</td><td>Giant Eagle</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your Lurlinite level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<h3>Timeless Body</h3>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Additionally, you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically.</p>\n\n<h3>Beast Spells</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your Lurlinite spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a Lurlinite spell while in beast form, but you aren't able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<h3>Archdruid</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your Lurlinite spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>\n\n<h2>Sacred Circles</h2>\n\n<h3>Circle of the Green</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The land remembers what the church would have us forget.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Circle of the Green draws power from the living land of Oz itself\u2014the ancient forests of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a>, the wild steppes of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'the Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a>, even the gardens and parks within cities. They believe that the land itself is sacred, imbued with Lurline's original magic, and that protecting nature is protecting the source of all life and magic in Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Cantrip</h4>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 1st level, you learn one additional Lurlinite cantrip of your choice.</p>\n\n<h4>Natural Recovery</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Lurlinite level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Circle Spells</h4>\n<p>Your connection to the land grants you access to certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells.</p>\n\n<p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a circle spell that doesn't appear on the Lurlinite spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Lurlinite spell for you.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Lurlinite Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>barkskin, spider climb</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>call lightning, plant growth</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>divination, freedom of movement</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>commune with nature, tree stride</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Land's Sanctuary</h4>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you are in a natural environment, beasts and plant creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Additionally, you can move through nonmagical difficult terrain made of plants without expending extra movement and without taking damage from thorns, spines, and similar hazards.</p>\n\n<h4>Nature's Ward</h4>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<h4>Nature's Sanctuary</h4>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Lurlinite spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>Circle of the Moon</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"In the beast form, we find our truest selves.\"</p>\n\n<p>Circle of the Moon Lurlinites have a special kinship with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> and believe that the barrier between human and beast consciousness is artificial, imposed by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist Church'); return false;\">Unionist Church</a> for political reasons. They can take animal forms more powerful than other Lurlinites, and many work directly with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Combat Wild Shape</h4>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action. Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p>\n\n<h4>Circle Forms</h4>\n<p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).</p>\n\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your Lurlinite level divided by 3, rounded down.</p>\n\n<h4>Primal Strike</h4>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<h4>Elemental Wild Shape</h4>\n<p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.</p>\n\n<h4>Thousand Forms</h4>\n<p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast *alter self* at will.</p>\n\n<h3>Circle of Liberation</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Where there is oppression, Lurline calls us to resist.\"</p>\n\n<p>Circle of Liberation Lurlinites are activist-priests who see their faith as inseparable from the struggle for justice. They hide <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> from <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist'); return false;\">Unionist</a> inquisitors, smuggle the persecuted along the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a>, heal the wounded, and strike back against tyranny. This circle is unique to Oz's political situation.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.</p>\n\n<h4>Lurline's Shield</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, your devotion to protecting the oppressed manifests as divine armor. While you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h4>Circle Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Lurlinite Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>aid, lesser restoration</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>beacon of hope, revivify</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>death ward, guardian of faith</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>mass cure wounds, raise dead</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn the Oppressor</h4>\n<p>At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words of condemnation. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist'); return false;\">Unionist</a>, government official, or creature serving an unjust authority within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Lurlinite level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>\n\n<h4>Liberation's Strike</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, when you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack or spell attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the start of your next turn.</p>\n\n<h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Lurlinite cantrip.</p>\n\n<h4>Lurline's Wrath</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a> or other persecuted creature you can see within 60 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to that damage and deal radiant damage to the attacker equal to your Lurlinite level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>If your campaign uses the optional multiclassing rules, here's what you need to know if you choose Lurlinite as one of your classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Wisdom score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies Gained</h3>\n<p>If Lurlinite isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, and shields (Lurlinites will not wear metal armor or use metal shields).</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Lurlinite</h2>\n\n<h3>Faith in Hiding</h3>\n<p>As a Lurlinite, you practice a forbidden religion in a land where your faith is branded heresy. You gather in secret, use code words to identify fellow believers, and constantly risk discovery. Your prayers are whispered in hidden groves, your rituals performed by moonlight in the wilderness. You may outwardly pretend to be Unionist while maintaining your true faith in secret.</p>\n\n<h3>Resistance and Compassion</h3>\n<p>Lurlinites tend toward compassion for the oppressed and resistance against tyranny. Many are involved in underground movements helping <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> escape persecution. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How public are you about your faith? Do you hide it completely?</li>\n<li>What drew you to Lurlinism over the official Unionist church?</li>\n<li>How do you feel about <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionists'); return false;\">Unionists</a>? Are they all oppressors, or can some be redeemed?</li>\n<li>What would you sacrifice to protect an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a> from persecution?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Lurlinite Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>Lurlinites often come from backgrounds like Outlander, Folk Hero, Hermit, or custom backgrounds like Underground Railroad Conductor, Secret Cultist, or Animal Rights Activist.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Lurlinites as NPCs</h3>\n<p>Lurlinite NPCs make excellent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Allies:</strong> Healers for the party, guides in wilderness areas, contacts in the Animal resistance, sources of pre-Unionist lore</li>\n<li><strong>Quest Givers:</strong> Asking the party to rescue imprisoned Animals, destroy Unionist relics desecrating sacred sites, retrieve ancient Lurlinite artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Complications:</strong> Their association with the party might draw Unionist attention, they might ask the party to take dangerous stands against authority</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Lurlinite-Animal Connection</h3>\n<p>The close association between Lurlinites and the Animal Resistance creates natural story hooks. A Lurlinite PC might be asked to hide refugees, might discover an Animal community, or might be suspected of Animal sympathies by authorities.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Sites</h3>\n<p>Ancient Lurlinite sacred sites exist throughout Oz\u2014stone circles in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'the Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a>, hidden groves in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a>, underwater shrines in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling lakes</a>.

Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Your innate magic or pact grants you the ability to cast spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Cantrips</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the Witch spell list. You learn additional Witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column.</p>\n\n<h4>Spell Slots</h4>\n<p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Witch spells of 1st through 9th level. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Witch spell list. The Spells Known column shows when you learn more Witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Witch spell list.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells, since the power of your magic relies on your force of will and personality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Witch spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch Path</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, choose the source of your witchcraft: the Path of Blood (innate power), Path of the Pact (bargained power), or Path of the Learned (studied power through texts like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'the Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>). Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch Sight</h3>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can see magic as others see color. You can cast *detect magic* at will, without expending a spell slot. Additionally, when you see a creature casting a spell, you can use your reaction to identify the spell being cast (DC 15 + spell level Intelligence (Arcana) check).</p>\n\n<h3>Font of Magic</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\n\n<h4>Sorcery Points</h4>\n<p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column (which equals your Witch level). You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Flexible Casting</h4>\n<p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating Spell Slots:</strong> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action. The created spell slot vanishes when you finish a long rest. See the Creating Spell Slots table.</li>\n<li><strong>Converting Spell Slots:</strong> As a bonus action, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Metamagic</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n\n<h4>Metamagic Options</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Careful Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</li>\n<li><strong>Distant Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowered Spell:</strong> When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Extended Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Heightened Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</li>\n<li><strong>Quickened Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</li>\n<li><strong>Twinned Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<h3>Broomflight</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, you learn to enchant a broom to serve as your flying mount. You can spend 10 minutes performing a ritual to bond with a broom. While riding your bonded broom, you have a flying speed of 50 feet. The broom has AC 15, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and you must bond with a new broom. You can have only one bonded broom at a time.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch Ascendant</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, your mastery of witchcraft reaches its apex. You regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no sorcery points remaining, you regain 4 sorcery points.</p>\n\n<h2>Witch Paths</h2>\n\n<h3>Path of Blood</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Magic runs in my veins. I was born this way.\"</p>\n\n<p>Witches of the Path of Blood are born with power coursing through them. Perhaps your mother was touched by wild magic during pregnancy, or your bloodline carries ancient fey heritage, or\u2014like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba'); return false;\">Elphaba</a>\u2014you emerged green-skinned and powerful from birth. Your magic is innate, instinctive, and often tied to strong emotion.</p>\n\n<h4>Born of Magic</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, your connection to magic manifests physically. Choose or roll on the Witch Mark table to determine your magical appearance. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Witch Mark (d6)</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>d6</th><th>Mark</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Green skin (like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba'); return false;\">Elphaba</a>)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Eyes that glow when casting spells</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>Hair that moves of its own accord</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>Shadow that doesn't match your movements</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>Temperature changes around you with your emotions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>Birthmark in the shape of an arcane symbol</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Empowered Magic</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you cast a Witch spell that deals damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.</p>\n\n<h4>Elemental Affinity</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.</p>\n\n<h4>Spell Resistance</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>\n\n<h4>Overwhelming Magic</h4>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, when you cast a spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>\n\n<h3>Path of the Pact</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I made a bargain. Power for a price.\"</p>\n\n<p>You gained your magic through a pact with a powerful entity\u2014perhaps a fey lord or lady, a devil offering temptation, the spirit of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/deadly-desert', 'the Deadly Desert'); return false;\">the Deadly Desert</a>, or even <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Time Dragon</a> itself. You serve your patron's interests (willingly or not) in exchange for magical power.</p>\n\n<h4>Pact Magic</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn two eldritch invocations of your choice from the warlock class. When you gain certain Witch levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Eldritch Invocations Known table.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Witch Level</th><th>Invocations Known</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>3</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td></tr>\n<tr><td>14th</td><td>5</td></tr>\n<tr><td>18th</td><td>6</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Patron's Gift</h4>\n<p>Also at 1st level, choose the type of entity you made your pact with. Your choice grants you a specific benefit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fey Patron:</strong> You can cast *misty step* once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiend Patron:</strong> You gain resistance to fire damage and can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Great Old One Patron:</strong> You can telepathically communicate with any creature you can see within 30 feet. You don't need to share a language, but the creature must understand at least one language.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Pact Boon</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, your patron bestows a gift upon you. Choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Chain:</strong> You learn *find familiar* and can cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one special form: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</li>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Blade:</strong> You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You choose the form (any melee weapon). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical. The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more or if you dismiss it (no action required).</li>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Tome:</strong> Your patron gives you a grimoire. Choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They are considered Witch spells for you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Patron's Blessing</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, your patron grants you a measure of their power. You can cast one 6th-level spell from your patron's spell list once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n\n<h4>Mystic Arcanum</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 7th-level spell from the Witch spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n\n<h4>Pact Master</h4>\n<p>At 18th level, you can petition your patron for aid. You can cast *wish* once. You must finish 30 days before you can do so again. When you use this feature, your patron always twists the wish in some way\u2014you get what you asked for, but there's always a price.</p>\n\n<h3>Path of the Learned</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I decoded the Grimmerie. I earned this power.\"</p>\n\n<p>You gained your magic through study of forbidden texts\u2014perhaps <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'the Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a> itself, or copies of its pages, or other dangerous magical writings. You are a scholar of the arcane, treating witchcraft as a science to be mastered rather than an innate gift or bargained power.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellbook</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level Witch spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the Witch spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n\n<h4>Preparing Spells</h4>\n<p>You prepare the list of Witch spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Witch spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Witch level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Learning Spells</h4>\n<p>Each time you gain a Witch level, you can add two Witch spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Additionally, when you find a wizard spell scroll or spellbook, you can add spells from it to your spellbook using the standard rules for learning wizard spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you can cast a Witch spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Arcane Recovery</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, you have learned to regain some magical energy through study. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your Witch level (rounded up), and none can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n\n<h4>Grimmerie Secrets</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, your study of forbidden texts has unlocked secret knowledge. Choose two spells from any class's spell list. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Witch table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as Witch spells for you and are added to your spellbook, but don't count against the number of spells you know.</p>\n\n<h4>Spell Mastery</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level or 2nd-level Witch spells that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Signature Spell</h4>\n<p>At 18th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Witch spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>If your campaign uses the optional multiclassing rules, here's what you need to know if you choose Witch as one of your classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher (Intelligence 13 if Path of the Learned).</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies Gained</h3>\n<p>If Witch isn't your initial class, you gain no additional proficiencies.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Witch</h2>\n\n<h3>The Weight of the Name</h3>\n<p>In Oz, \"witch\" carries heavy connotations. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba</a> became the Wicked Witch of the West\u2014but was she wicked, or was wickedness thrust upon her? Consider how your witch navigates this legacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you embrace the title \"witch\" or shy away from it?</li>\n<li>How do people react when they learn what you are?</li>\n<li>Are you fighting against Elphaba's dark reputation, or living up to it?</li>\n<li>What's your relationship with institutional magic users like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'Adepts'); return false;\">Adepts</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Moral Ambiguity</h3>\n<p>Witches in Oz exist in moral gray areas.

Finding it, reading it, protecting it, or destroying it can drive entire story arcs.</p>\n\n<h3>Persecution and Power</h3>\n<p>Witches are both feared and hunted. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist Church'); return false;\">Unionist Church</a> actively persecutes them.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Sneak Attack</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n\n<p>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column.</p>\n\n<h3>Thieves' Cant</h3>\n<p>During your training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. It also includes a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages.</p>\n\n<h3>Cunning Action</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n\n<h3>Agent Specialization</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you choose a specialization: Shadow Agent or Political Operative. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.</p>\n\n<h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>\n\n<h3>Evasion</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<h3>Reliable Talent</h3>\n<p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<h3>Blindsense</h3>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<h3>Slippery Mind</h3>\n<p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<h3>Elusive</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.</p>\n\n<h3>Stroke of Luck</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Agent Specializations</h2>\n\n<h3>Shadow Agent</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I am the knife in the dark, the secret that dies with its keeper.\"</p>\n\n<p>Shadow Agents are assassins, infiltrators, and saboteurs. They excel at entering forbidden places, eliminating targets, and vanishing without a trace. Many work for <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'the Wizard\\'s'); return false;\">the Wizard's</a> secret police, while others serve resistance movements or operate as freelance killers.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.</p>\n\n<h4>Assassinate</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>\n\n<h4>Infiltration Expertise</h4>\n<p>At 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. However, you can adopt the new identity as a disguise with the help of a disguise kit. Other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>\n\n<h4>Impostor</h4>\n<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.</p>\n\n<p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>\n\n<h4>Death Strike</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>\n\n<h3>Political Operative</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The pen is mightier than the sword\u2014but blackmail is mightiest of all.\"</p>\n\n<p>Political Operatives navigate the treacherous waters of Ozian politics, dealing in secrets, influence, and leverage. They might work for <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> officials, foreign powers, or themselves, always playing multiple sides against each other.</p>\n\n<h4>Master of Intrigue</h4>\n<p>When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land.</p>\n\n<h4>Master of Tactics</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</p>\n\n<h4>Insightful Manipulator</h4>\n<p>At 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The GM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intelligence score</li>\n<li>Wisdom score</li>\n<li>Charisma score</li>\n<li>Class levels (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the GM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.</p>\n\n<h4>Misdirection</h4>\n<p>Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.</p>\n\n<h4>Soul of Deceit</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful, if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Dexterity score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<p>If Agent isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and one skill from the class's skill list, as well as thieves' tools.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying an Agent</h2>\n\n<h3>Loyalty and Betrayal</h3>\n<p>As an Agent, you live in a world of shifting allegiances. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who do you really serve? Is your public loyalty genuine or cover?</li>\n<li>Have you ever betrayed someone? Do you regret it?</li>\n<li>What lines won't you cross, even for your mission?</li>\n<li>How do you maintain your sense of self when constantly lying?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Weight of Secrets</h3>\n<p>Agents carry dangerous knowledge. In Oz's surveillance state, knowing the wrong thing can be fatal\u2014but so can not knowing enough.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Agents in Oz</h3>\n<p>Oz's police state creates perfect conditions for Agent campaigns. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'Wizard'); return false;\">Wizard</a> employs countless spies, while resistance movements need their own operatives. Every faction has Agents, and double agents are everywhere.</p>\n\n<h3>Information as Currency</h3>\n<p>In campaigns featuring Agents, treat information as valuable as gold. Secret documents, blackmail material, and surveillance reports can drive entire story arcs.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard'); return false;\">The Wizard</a> - The surveillance state</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">The Gale Force</a> - Resistance operatives</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> - Center of intrigue</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> - Underground network</li>\n</ul>",

Your Academic die changes when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Academic Dice column.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.</p>\n\n<h3>Font of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Academic Support when you finish a short or long rest. The size of your Academic dice increases to d8 at 5th level, d10 at 10th level, and d12 at 15th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Expertise</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n\n<h3>Superior Inspiration</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Academic Support left, you regain one use.</p>\n\n<h2>Fields of Study</h2>\n\n<h3>Natural Philosophy</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Magic is a science waiting to be understood.\"</p>\n\n<p>Natural Philosophers study the fundamental laws governing magic, nature, and reality. They might research at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a>, analyze <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animal</a> consciousness, or attempt to decode <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'the Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>. Like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a>, they seek objective truth\u2014which can be very dangerous in Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Arcane Analysis</h4>\n<p>When you choose this field at 1st level, you learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these cantrips.</p>\n\n<h4>Scientific Method</h4>\n<p>Also at 1st level, when you make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Nature) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<h4>Cutting Words</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Academic Support, rolling an Academic die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.</p>\n\n<h4>Counterspell Expert</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can cast *counterspell* once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you use *counterspell* in this way, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the ability check.</p>\n\n<h4>Theorist's Insight</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration on their spell.</p>\n\n<h3>Historical Research</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Those who control the past control the future.\"</p>\n\n<p>Historical Researchers study Oz's past\u2014including the parts the government wants forgotten. They document the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/quadling-genocide', 'Quadling Genocide'); return false;\">Quadling Genocide</a>, preserve pre-Unionist traditions, and maintain the truth against official propaganda. This work is essential but perilous.</p>\n\n<h4>Historical Expertise</h4>\n<p>When you choose this field at 1st level, you gain proficiency in History. If you are already proficient in History, you gain expertise in it instead. Additionally, you learn to read, write, and speak two additional languages of your choice.</p>\n\n<h4>Keen Mind</h4>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>\n\n<h4>Tales of Inspiration</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you use your Academic Support feature, you can speak of historical heroes and their deeds. The recipient of your Academic die gains temporary hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<h4>Historian's Warning</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use your reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet is about to make a saving throw to grant them advantage on the roll, as you recall historical precedent for overcoming similar dangers. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Master Researcher</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when you spend at least 1 hour researching a topic in a library, archive, or similar repository of knowledge, you automatically learn any information that is recorded there about that topic, no roll required. Additionally, you can perfectly recall any text you have read in the past month.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<p>If Scholar isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and two skills from the class's skill list.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Scholar</h2>\n\n<h3>Dangerous Knowledge</h3>\n<p>As a Scholar in Oz, you pursue knowledge that others fear. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What forbidden topic drives your research?</li>\n<li>Have you published under your own name or anonymously?</li>\n<li>What would you risk to preserve an important truth?</li>\n<li>How do you feel about state-controlled education?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Teacher or Researcher</h3>\n<p>Scholars might focus on teaching (inspiring others with knowledge) or pure research (discovering new truths). Both paths matter in Oz's fight for truth.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Scholars as Support</h3>\n<p>Scholars excel at supporting allies through Academic Support, making them valuable party members even without combat magic.</p>\n\n<h3>Research-Based Adventures</h3>\n<p>Scholar PCs create natural hooks for research-based quests: finding lost texts, interviewing survivors, accessing forbidden archives, or proving historical truths.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a> - Center of learning</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a> - Martyred scholar</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a> - Subject of study</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/quadling-genocide', 'Quadling Genocide'); return false;\">Quadling Genocide</a> - Suppressed history</li>\n</ul>",

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Satire</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I speak truth to power\u2014and make them laugh while doing it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Satirical Performers use mockery, wit, and cutting words as weapons against tyranny and pretension.</p>\n\n<h4>Cutting Words</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of Performance Inspiration, rolling the die and subtracting the number from the creature's roll. You can use this after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it succeeds or fails.</p>\n\n<h4>Additional Magical Secrets</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you learn two additional spells from any class. These count as Performer spells for you but don't count against your number of spells known.</p>\n\n<h4>Peerless Skill</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Performance Inspiration, rolling the die and adding it to your ability check. You can do this after seeing the roll but before knowing whether you succeed or fail.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher. If Performer isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and one skill of your choice, plus one musical instrument of your choice.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Performer</h2>\n\n<h3>Art and Politics</h3>\n<p>As a Performer in Oz, consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you perform state-approved material or subversive art?</li>\n<li>Have you ever been censored? How did you respond?</li>\n<li>What message do you want your art to convey?</li>\n<li>Do you see yourself as entertainer or activist\u2014or both?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Performance and Propaganda</h3>\n<p>In Oz's authoritarian state, all public performance is political. State theaters spread propaganda, while underground shows spread resistance messages.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> - Theater district</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard'); return false;\">The Wizard</a> - Censor-in-chief</li>\n</ul>",

They obey your commands and fight with the skill of ancient Quadling warriors. When the spell ends or a corpse drops to 0 hit points, the spirit departs peacefully.</p>\n\n<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>\n\n<p>Domingon magic is inseparable from Quadling culture. The tradition emphasizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> Many spells are more powerful when cast with multiple participants</li>\n<li><strong>Respect:</strong> Spirits must be approached with proper ritual and offerings</li>\n<li><strong>Memory:</strong> The dead are not gone; they remain accessible through trance and ritual</li>\n<li><strong>Liminality:</strong> Power comes from walking between worlds\u2014waking/dreaming, living/dead, material/spiritual</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Learning Domingon Magic</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;\">Grimmerie magic</a> which can be learned from books, Domingon magic requires personal instruction from a spirit-walker or participation in Quadling community rituals. Non-Quadlings who learn this tradition often do so through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended time living in Quadling communities</li>\n<li>Marriage or adoption into Quadling families</li>\n<li>Being chosen by ancestral spirits in dreams</li>\n<li>Rescue or aid given to Quadling people, earning their trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Ritual Requirements</h3>\n<p>Many Domingon spells benefit from or require ritual casting. Consider requiring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drums, rattles, or other percussion instruments</li>\n<li>Ritual body paint or scarification</li>\n<li>Circle of participants (even if they're not spellcasters)</li>\n<li>Blood offerings (minor cuts, not life-threatening)</li>\n<li>Specific moon phases or times of day</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Spirit Interaction</h3>\n<p>Ancestral spirits in Domingon magic are not mere spell effects\u2014they're characters. Give them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distinct personalities based on their lives</li>\n<li>Opinions about current events and how the living honor the dead</li>\n<li>Willingness to help or refuse based on proper respect being shown</li>\n<li>Cultural knowledge from their era</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Political Context</h3>\n<p>In the Wizard's Oz, Domingon magic is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewed with suspicion by Emerald City authorities</li>\n<li>Tolerated in Quadling Country but monitored</li>\n<li>Sometimes confused with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'Witch'); return false;\">Witchcraft</a> by ignorant officials</li>\n<li>A source of cultural resistance and Quadling identity</li>\n<li>Increasingly rare as younger Quadlings assimilate to Emerald City culture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;\">Quadling</a> - The people who practice this tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a> - Can choose Domingon as their magical tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;\">Grimmerie Tradition</a> - Contrasting arcane tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">The Witch</a> - May learn Domingon magic through cultural exchange</li>\n</ul>\n",

The Animal is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions harm it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This is how most Animals come into being in Oz. It's extraordinarily controversial and considered heresy by the Unionist Church. Using this spell publicly will result in immediate persecution.</p>\n\n<h3>Memory of the Land (3rd Circle)</h3>\n<p><strong>School:</strong> Divination (ritual)<br>\n<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br>\n<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br>\n<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (dirt or plant matter from the location)<br>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>\n\n<p>You touch the ground and commune with the land itself, accessing its ancient memory.

The Hunt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obeys your telepathic commands</li>\n<li>Hunts down one target you designate (must have seen or have a piece of them)</li>\n<li>Can track prey unerringly within 10 miles</li>\n<li>Vanishes when the target is defeated or the spell ends</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> The Wild Hunt is terrifying and associated with the old, wild magic of Oz. Using this spell marks the caster as a powerful and dangerous Lurlinite.</p>\n\n<h3>Speak with Animal Consciousness (2nd Circle)</h3>\n<p><strong>School:</strong> Divination (ritual)<br>\n<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>\n<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br>\n<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <em>speak with animals</em>, this spell specifically allows you to communicate with conscious <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> telepathically, even if you don't share a language. For the duration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You and the Animal can communicate complex thoughts and emotions</li>\n<li>The Animal can share memories and experiences visually</li>\n<li>You gain advantage on Persuasion checks with the Animal</li>\n<li>The Animal can sense your intentions (you can't lie convincingly)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This spell is how Lurlinites coordinate with Animal resistance fighters without speaking aloud and risking detection.</p>\n\n<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>\n\n<p>Lurline magic is the spiritual heart of the Animal resistance movement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> Predates all other magical traditions in Oz</li>\n<li><strong>Natural:</strong> Flows from the land itself, not from books or institutions</li>\n<li><strong>Forbidden:</strong> Practicing Lurline magic openly is heresy in most of Oz</li>\n<li><strong>Communal:</strong> Often taught orally, practitioner to practitioner, in secret</li>\n<li><strong>Liberation:</strong> Many spells specifically help Animals and resist state oppression</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Learning Lurline Magic</h2>\n\n<p>Lurline magic cannot be learned from books or institutions. It requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct teaching from an existing Lurlinite</li>\n<li>Deep connection to natural Oz (spending months in wilderness)</li>\n<li>Acceptance by nature spirits or fey creatures</li>\n<li>Sometimes spontaneous awakening in times of great need (especially for Animals)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> have an instinctive connection to Lurline magic and can learn it more easily than humanoids.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Power and Persecution</h3>\n<p>Lurlinites walk a dangerous path in the Wizard's Oz:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their magic is illegal in most regions</li>\n<li>They're hunted by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist'); return false;\">Unionist Inquisitors</a></li>\n<li>They're heroes to the Animal resistance</li>\n<li>Their spells directly counter Unionist control magic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Environmental Connection</h3>\n<p>Consider requiring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Urban Penalty:</strong> Lurline spells might require higher-level spell slots in cities</li>\n<li><strong>Corrupted Land:</strong> Areas scarred by industrialization might block Lurline magic entirely</li>\n<li><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong> Ancient groves and Lurline shrines might grant bonus effects</li>\n<li><strong>The Green:</strong> Lurline magic is strongest in the Great Gillikin Forest and other wild places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Lurline Herself</h3>\n<p>Is Lurline a god, a fairy queen, or simply a mythologized magical force? Different Lurlinites have different beliefs. Unlike the Unnamed God, Lurline doesn't grant explicit divine intervention\u2014her power flows more subtly through nature itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'The Lurlinite'); return false;\">The Lurlinite</a> - Primary class using this tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> - The fairy queen who blessed Oz</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> - Often instinctively connected to Lurline magic</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/unionist-tradition', 'Unionist Tradition'); return false;\">Unionist Tradition</a> - Rival divine tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">The Witch</a> - Some witches learn Lurline magic</li>\n</ul>\n",
