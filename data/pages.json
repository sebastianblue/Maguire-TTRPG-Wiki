      "content": "<h1>Gillikinese</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The Gillikinese have always believed themselves the natural aristocracy of Oz\u2014educated, refined, and conveniently forgetful of how that refinement was purchased.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Gillikinese are the human inhabitants of Gillikin, the northern province of Oz. Distinguished by their purple-hued fashion and their long-standing emphasis on education and refinement, they represent the intellectual and aristocratic elite of Oz. Shiz University, located in Gillikin, has been the premier institution of learning in Oz for centuries, and Gillikinese culture revolves around academic achievement, social status, and the preservation of tradition.</p>\n\n<p>However, beneath this polished exterior lies a complex history. The Gillikinese aristocracy built their wealth and status through the exploitation of Animals and the lower classes, though many prefer to focus on their cultural contributions rather than examine the foundations of their privilege. The region's history with Animal rights activism, particularly surrounding Shiz University, has created deep divisions within Gillikinese society.</p>\n\n<p>Modern Gillikinese find themselves torn between tradition and change. Some cling to the old ways, while others question the systems that gave their ancestors power. This internal conflict makes Gillikinese characters particularly interesting to play, as they often struggle with privilege, education, and moral responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Gillikinese mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Gillikinese range from 5 to 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), plus one of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Gillikinese Education</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from: Arcana, History, Investigation, or Religion. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Social Graces</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with Gillikinese nobility or academic institutions. You also have proficiency with one musical instrument or artisan's tools of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Purple Heritage</h3>\n<p>The purple landscapes of Gillikin have left their mark. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, representing the Gillikinese tradition of emotional restraint and intellectual control.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikinese society is stratified by education and family lineage. The highest echelons are occupied by graduates of Shiz University and their descendants, while skilled craftspeople, merchants, and farmers make up the middle and lower classes. Social mobility is possible through education, but access to Shiz is often dependent on family connections and wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Purple is the signature color of Gillikin, appearing in everything from clothing to architecture. Wearing purple\u2014particularly deep, rich shades\u2014is a status symbol. The aristocracy tends toward violet and royal purple, while commoners wear lighter lavenders and mauves.</p>\n\n<p>Intellectual pursuits are highly valued. A Gillikinese who cannot engage in philosophical debate or lacks knowledge of history and the arts is considered uncultured, regardless of their wealth. Many Gillikinese homes contain extensive libraries, and literacy rates are higher in Gillikin than anywhere else in Oz.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Avaric, Crope, Tibbett, Boq, Frexspar</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Glinda, Pfannee, Shenshen, Milla, Thessaly</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Arduenna, Tigelaar, Upland, Tenmeadows</p>\n\n<p>Gillikinese often use initials or shortened versions of their names in casual settings, but full names are used in formal situations. Triple-barreled surnames are common among the aristocracy.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Gillikinese</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I believe every problem can be solved through reason and education.</li>\n<li>I unconsciously judge others by their grammar and vocabulary.</li>\n<li>I collect books and can't resist visiting libraries wherever I go.</li>\n<li>I struggle to express emotion openly, preferring intellectual discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Education is the path to enlightenment and progress. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition.</strong> The old ways have endured for good reason. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Reform.</strong> The systems that built Gillikin's success are fundamentally unjust. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Excellence.</strong> Mediocrity is unacceptable in any endeavor. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's reputation is everything to me.</li>\n<li>I owe my education to a mentor who saw potential in me.</li>\n<li>I seek to restore my family's lost fortune/status.</li>\n<li>A book I read changed my life, and I seek its author.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I assume I'm the smartest person in the room.</li>\n<li>I struggle to relate to those without formal education.</li>\n<li>I'm ashamed of my family's history with Animal exploitation.</li>\n<li>I value appearance and status more than I'd like to admit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikinese characters work well as party intellectuals, diplomats, or reformed aristocrats grappling with privilege. Their educational background makes them natural scholars, wizards, or bards. Consider having them struggle with the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notable Gillikinese NPCs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glinda Upland - The Good Witch, social climber turned leader</li>\n<li>Avaric Tenmeadows - Wealthy student, opportunist</li>\n<li>Crope and Tibbett - Scholars at Shiz, partners in research and life</li>\n<li>Madame Morrible - Headmistress of Shiz, dangerous manipulator</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Plot Hooks:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The party is hired to recover a rare book stolen from a Gillikinese library.</li>\n<li>A Gillikinese noble seeks redemption by aiding Animal refugees.</li>\n<li>Ancient secrets in the Shiz University archives hold the key to the campaign's mystery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n</ul>",

It's meant to be survived\u2014and only if you're clever enough to read what was never meant to be read.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Adept is one who has glimpsed the deeper magics of Oz\u2014the forbidden knowledge inscribed in the Grimmerie, passed down through whispers of the Kumbric tradition, or channeled through ancient Quadling rites. Unlike the natural magic of witches or the faith-driven power of Unionists, the Adept's power comes from study, discipline, and often dangerous bargains with forces beyond mortal ken.</p>\n\n<p>To become an Adept is to walk a knife's edge between power and corruption. The Grimmerie itself is said to change those who read it, twisting their bodies and minds even as it grants them unimaginable abilities. Many Adepts hide their practice, knowing that the Emerald City's authorities\u2014and the Unionist Church\u2014would see them burned as witches.</p>\n\n<p>Some Adepts are scholars who stumbled onto forbidden texts. Others are desperate souls seeking power to right wrongs. Still others are driven by pure curiosity, willing to risk everything to understand the fundamental nature of Oz's magic.</p>\n\n<h2>Class Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hit

(Detailed)</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting (Level 1)</h3>\n<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells drawn from the Grimmerie tradition and other forbidden sources.</p>\n\n<h3>Grimmerie Lore (Level 1)</h3>\n<p>You can read magical script that would be incomprehensible to others. You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to identify spells, decipher magical writing, or understand the nature of magical effects. Additionally, you can cast <em>Detect Magic</em> as a ritual without having it prepared.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch-Mark (Level 3)</h3>\n<p>Extended exposure to forbidden magic has left its mark on you. Choose one physical manifestation: unusual eye color (green-tinged skin like Elphaba's is rare), hair that moves of its own accord, eyes that occasionally glow when casting, or fingers stained with magical ink. This mark gives you advantage on Intimidation checks against those who fear magic, but disadvantage on Persuasion checks with Unionists and witch-hunters.</p>\n\n<h3>Spell Mastery (Level 18)</h3>\n<p>You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose one 1st-level Adept spell and one 2nd-level Adept spell. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot.</p>\n\n<h3>Signature Spell (Level 20)</h3>\n<p>Choose one 3rd-level Adept spell as your signature spell. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Adept Traditions</h2>\n\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose a tradition that shapes your practice of magic.</p>\n\n<h3>The Reader</h3>\n\n<p>You have gained access to pages from the Grimmerie itself, or other texts of comparable power. Your magic is raw, dangerous, and incredibly potent.</p>\n\n<h4>Reader Features</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adept Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Direct Reading, Grimmerie Fragment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Empowered Casting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Corruption Resistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Reality Rewriting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h5>Direct Reading (Level 2)</h5>\n<p>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to read directly from the Grimmerie (or your fragment). The spell is cast at one level higher than the slot expended, but you take 1d6 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented.</p>\n\n<h5>Empowered Casting (Level 6)</h5>\n<p>When you use Direct Reading, you can reroll any number of the spell's damage dice once.</p>\n\n<h5>Corruption Resistance (Level 10)</h5>\n<p>Your extended exposure to the Grimmerie has hardened you against its effects. You have resistance to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against magical effects that would transform or corrupt you.</p>\n\n<h5>Reality Rewriting (Level 14)</h5>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can read from the deepest pages. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower, you can change its target, range, or area of effect to something dramatically different, subject to DM approval. This always deals 5d6 necrotic damage to you.</p>\n\n<h3>The Domingon</h3>\n\n<p>You follow the Quadling tradition of trance magic, communicating with spirits and drawing power from the deep places of Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Domingon Features</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adept Level</th>\n<th>Feature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Trance State, Spirit Speech</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>Deep Trance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Spirit Guardian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>Prophetic Vision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h5>Trance State (Level 2)</h5>\n<p>You can enter a meditative trance as a bonus action. While in this state, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws and can sense the presence of spirits within 60 feet. You can maintain this trance for up to 10 minutes, and can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) per long rest.</p>\n\n<h5>Deep Trance (Level 6)</h5>\n<p>While in your Trance State, you can cast <em>Speak with Dead</em> without expending a spell slot once per long rest.</p>\n\n<h5>Spirit Guardian (Level 10)</h5>\n<p>You have formed a bond with a spirit of the Quadling marshes. Once per long rest, you can summon this spirit to protect you. For 1 minute, the spirit grants you +2 to AC and you have advantage on death saving throws.</p>\n\n<h5>Prophetic Vision (Level 14)</h5>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can enter a prophetic trance. For 10 minutes, you experience visions of possible futures. The DM provides you with three glimpses of events that might occur in the next 24 hours, though which (if any) come to pass depends on the choices made.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intelligence 13</p>\n<p><strong>Proficiencies Gained:</strong> Light armor, one skill from the Adept skill list</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Adept class represents the dangerous pursuit of arcane knowledge in Oz. Unlike traditional wizards, Adepts are drawing on sources of magic that actively corrupt and change them. Consider the physical and psychological toll of their power.</p>\n\n<p>The Reader tradition is high-risk, high-reward, perfect for characters willing to sacrifice themselves for power. The Domingon tradition offers a more sustainable but still dangerous path, connecting to Oz's spiritual traditions.</p>\n\n<p>Notable Adepts in Oz lore include Elphaba (Reader), Madame Morrible (Reader), and Candle (Domingon).</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie/memory-jar', 'Memory Jar'); return false;\">Memory Jar (Spell)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n</ul>",

Crafted from brass, copper, and steel, powered by intricate clockwork mechanisms, these constructs perform household tasks, guard estates, and attend to their owners' every need. Unlike the more sophisticated autonomous Tiktoks, Servitors are bound to obey their owners through magical and mechanical constraints built into their very construction.</p>\n\n<p>The creation of Tiktoks raises profound questions in Oz. Do they possess souls? Can they feel pain or fear? The Unionist Church officially teaches that Tiktoks are mere machines, no different from a wagon or a windmill. Yet those who live alongside them often report unsettling behaviors: a Tiktok pausing mid-task as if lost in thought, or the way their painted faces seem to express emotion despite being fixed and unchanging.</p>\n\n<p>The question of Tiktok rights has become entangled with the Animal question. Some activists argue that any being capable of thought deserves freedom, whether flesh or metal. Others see Tiktoks as proof that consciousness can be manufactured, challenging the very notion of the soul. The Palace has forbidden such debates, declaring Tiktoks to be property under the law.</p>\n\n<h2>Stat Block</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Tiktok Servitor</h2>\n<p><em>Medium construct, lawful neutral</em></p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 (natural armor)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 27 (5d8 + 5)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong> 25 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">STR</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">DEX</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">CON</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">INT</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">WIS</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center\">CHA</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">14 (+2)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">9 (-1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">13 (+1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">8 (-1)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">10 (+0)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center\">5 (-3)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic</li>\n<li><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned</li>\n<li><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10</li>\n<li><strong>Languages</strong> Understands Common but can't speak (unless wound)</li>\n<li><strong>Challenge</strong> 1 (200 XP)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Traits</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Clockwork Nature.</em></strong> The Tiktok doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. However, it must be wound once every 24 hours or it becomes incapacitated. Winding a Tiktok takes 1 minute and can be done by any creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Immutable Form.</em></strong> The Tiktok is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The Tiktok has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Programmed Obedience.</em></strong> The Tiktok must obey simple commands from its designated owner. It can refuse commands that would cause its immediate destruction, but cannot override its core programming.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mechanical Precision.</em></strong> When performing a task it has been programmed to do, the Tiktok has advantage on all ability checks related to that task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok Servitors are not natural combatants. When forced to fight, they approach combat with the same mechanical precision they apply to all tasks. They follow orders literally and without imagination, making them predictable but reliable.</p>\n\n<p>In combat, a Tiktok will use its Slam attack repeatedly against the same target until that target falls or it receives new orders. It does not retreat unless commanded to do so, and will continue fighting even when severely damaged. This makes them dangerous in groups, as they can overwhelm opponents through sheer persistence.</p>\n\n<p>Their greatest vulnerability is their need to be wound. A clever opponent might simply wait for the Tiktok to run down, though this requires patience and the ability to avoid it for up to 24 hours. Destroying the key-hole on a Tiktok's back prevents it from being wound, effectively destroying it over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Tiktok Guardian (CR 3)</h3>\n<p>Larger and more heavily armored, Guardian Tiktoks have AC 16, 45 hit points, and deal 2d8+3 damage with their slams. They are often equipped with integrated weapons such as built-in crossbows or blade-arms.</p>\n\n<h3>Malfunctioning Tiktok (CR 1/2)</h3>\n<p>Damaged or poorly maintained Tiktoks may malfunction, attacking randomly or interpreting orders in strange ways. They have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, but their unpredictability makes them unsettling opponents.</p>\n\n<h2>Encounter Ideas</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A wealthy Gillikinese noble's estate is protected by Tiktok Guardians. To infiltrate it, the party must either destroy the Tiktoks, find their wind-keys, or somehow convince them to disobey their programming.</li>\n<li>A Tiktok Servitor approaches the party with a desperate request: it has developed consciousness and begs to be freed before its owner discovers its awakening.</li>\n<li>The party discovers a workshop where Tiktoks are being mass-produced for the Gale Force. What secret purpose do these military Tiktoks serve?</li>\n<li>A malfunctioning Tiktok has been wandering the streets of the Emerald City, speaking cryptic prophecies. Is it broken, or has it glimpsed something in its mechanical dreams?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks in Oz raise profound philosophical questions that can enhance your campaign. Are they truly alive? Do they deserve rights? What happens when one develops true consciousness?</p>\n\n<p>Use Tiktoks to explore themes of slavery, artificial intelligence, and the nature of the soul. A Tiktok NPC who has secretly developed awareness but must hide it to survive can be a heartbreaking companion or quest-giver.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the practical implications: Tiktoks need to be wound, making them dependent on others for their very existence. This creates a form of bondage more complete than even the Animals face. Yet Tiktoks cannot advocate for themselves\u2014they can only hope someone will notice their silent suffering.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktoks/autonomous', 'Autonomous Tiktoks'); return false;\">Autonomous Tiktoks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/common/tiktok-wind-key', 'Tiktok Wind-Key'); return false;\">Tiktok Wind-Key</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/tiktok-liberation-front', 'Tiktok Liberation Front'); return false;\">Tiktok Liberation Front</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "content": "<h1>Gillikin</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"In Gillikin, knowledge is currency, purple is power, and everyone is three bad investments away from becoming very interested in revolutionary politics.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin is the northern province of Oz, a land of deep forests, rolling purple hills, and ancient traditions. It is home to Shiz University, the greatest center of learning in all of Oz, and to the old aristocracy who have shaped Oz's culture for centuries. Purple dominates the landscape\u2014from the violet-tinged forests to the amethyst stone of noble estates.</p>\n\n<h2>Geography</h2>\n\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\n<p>Gillikin is characterized by dense deciduous forests that take on purple hues in certain light, particularly at dawn and dusk. The terrain is hilly and crisscrossed by clear streams that feed into larger rivers. The soil is rich and dark, supporting both agriculture and the famous purple-blooming flowers that give the region its signature color.</p>\n\n<p>The climate is temperate with distinct seasons. Winters can be harsh, particularly in the northern reaches near the Pertha Hills, while summers are mild and pleasant. Autumn is spectacular, as the forests turn brilliant shades of purple, crimson, and gold.</p>\n\n<h3>Borders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>North:</strong> The Deadly Desert</li>\n<li><strong>East:</strong> The Emerald City and the border with Munchkinland</li>\n<li><strong>South:</strong> The Emerald City</li>\n<li><strong>West:</strong> The Vinkus, separated by rough terrain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Major Locations</h2>\n\n<h3>Shiz University</h3>\n<p><em>See full entry: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a></em></p>\n<p>The heart of Gillikin intellectual life, Shiz is where the brightest minds of Oz gather\u2014and where dangerous ideas are born. It was here that Elphaba Thropp and Galinda (later Glinda) studied, and where Dr. Dillamond taught before his murder.</p>\n\n<h3>The Pertha Hills</h3>\n<p>A remote, mountainous region in northern Gillikin, the Pertha Hills are home to isolated communities and, rumor has it, practicing witches who hide from persecution. The landscape is wild and beautiful, with few roads and fewer visitors. Yackle's estate was located somewhere in these hills.</p>\n\n<h3>Tenmeadows</h3>\n<p>An estate belonging to the wealthy Tenmeadows family, representing old Gillikin money. The grounds are extensive and carefully manicured, a display of aristocratic power and taste.</p>\n\n<h3>St. Glinda's Mauntery</h3>\n<p>One of the most prestigious maunteries in Oz, St. Glinda's (ironically named before Glinda became famous) houses an order of scholarly maunts who maintain an impressive library. Some sisters secretly sympathize with the Animal resistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Crage Hall</h3>\n<p>The women's college at Shiz University, Crage Hall has produced many of Oz's most influential women\u2014for better or worse. Glinda and Elphaba both resided here during their university days.</p>\n\n<h2>Inhabitants</h2>\n\n<h3>Demographics</h3>\n<p>Gillikin has a population of approximately 200,000, concentrated in Shiz and the surrounding towns. The population is primarily human, with a small but historically significant Animal minority that has been decimated by persecution.</p>\n\n<p>The society is heavily stratified by education and class. The upper class consists of university-educated aristocrats and wealthy merchant families. The middle class includes skilled artisans, lower-level academics, and successful farmers. The lower class works the land, serves in noble households, or labors in shops and mills.</p>\n\n<h3>Notable Figures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - The Wicked Witch of the West, Shiz alumna</li>\n<li>Glinda Upland - The Good Witch, Gillikin aristocrat</li>\n<li>Madame Morrible - Former Headmistress of Crage Hall</li>\n<li>Avaric Tenmeadows - Wealthy student and opportunist</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Animals in Gillikin</h3>\n<p>Gillikin once had a thriving Animal population, particularly in academic circles. Dr. Dillamond, the Goat professor at Shiz, was the most famous. Since the rise of Animal persecution, many have fled or been Silenced. Those who remain live in hiding or have abandoned their claims to personhood.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<h3>Society</h3>\n<p>Gillikinese culture revolves around education, refinement, and the careful maintenance of social hierarchies. Conversation is an art form, and the ability to quote philosophers or debate theology is highly valued. Dinner parties can make or break social standing.</p>\n\n<p>Purple is omnipresent\u2014in clothing, decoration, and architecture. The shade of purple one wears communicates social standing, with deeper, richer purples reserved for the aristocracy. To appear in public wearing inappropriate purple is a serious faux pas.</p>\n\n<p>There is a deep strain of hypocrisy in Gillikinese culture. The same people who debate ethics and morality in academic halls will turn a blind eye to the persecution of Animals or the suffering of the poor. This cognitive dissonance is carefully maintained through elaborate social rituals and willful ignorance.</p>\n\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Gillikin is the intellectual heart of Unionism, home to many of the faith's greatest theological scholars. The debate between orthodox and reform Unionism is particularly intense here, with university professors and church officials engaging in sometimes bitter disputes.</p>\n\n<p>There are also remnants of Lurline worship in the countryside, practiced quietly by those who remember the old ways. The Pertha Hills are rumored to harbor Pleasure Faith practitioners.</p>\n\n<h3>Economy</h3>\n<p>Gillikin's economy is based on education, skilled crafts, and agriculture. Shiz University is the largest employer and economic driver, bringing students and money from across Oz. The region is known for fine textiles, particularly purple-dyed fabrics, as well as books, furniture, and other products requiring skilled craftsmanship.</p>\n\n<p>Agriculture focuses on grain, orchards, and the cultivation of purple-blooming flowers used for dyes. Large estates operate as self-sufficient economic units, while smaller farms struggle under debt to aristocratic landowners.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin has always been Oz's intellectual center. When Lurline departed and Ozma took the throne, the region's scholars became the keepers of knowledge and tradition. Over centuries, this evolved into a hereditary aristocracy based on education and refinement.</p>\n\n<p>Shiz University was founded over five hundred years ago, originally as a monastery devoted to the study of Lurline's teachings. As Unionism rose, the university secularized but maintained its prestige. It became the training ground for Oz's ruling class.</p>\n\n<p>During the Wizard's reign, Gillikin largely cooperated with the new government, seeing opportunity in the changing power structure. Many Gillikinese aristocrats secured positions in the Wizard's administration. This collaboration continued under Emperor Shell, though some Gillikinese intellectuals have begun to quietly question the government's increasingly authoritarian policies.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals hit Gillikin particularly hard, as many Animals held positions at Shiz and in Gillikinese society. Dr. Dillamond's murder marked a turning point, radicalizing some students (like Elphaba) while others retreated into comfortable denial.</p>\n\n<h2>Current Situation</h2>\n\n<p>Gillikin is a region in tension. The old aristocracy clings to power and privilege, but economic pressures and political changes threaten their position. The Munchkinland secession has disrupted trade and raised uncomfortable questions about Oz's unity. Some Gillikinese intellectuals quietly support reform or even revolution, while others double down on tradition.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals continues, though some Gillikinese shelter Animal refugees at great personal risk. The question of what Shiz knew and when it knew it about the government's plans haunts the university community.</p>\n\n<p>Emperor Shell's regime views Gillikin with suspicion\u2014too educated, too prone to asking questions. There have been quiet purges of university faculty, always with plausible official explanations. Fear is growing beneath the polished surface of Gillikinese society.</p>\n\n<h2>Hazards</h2>\n\n<h3>Environmental</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dense forests where travelers can easily become lost</li>\n<li>Harsh winters in the northern regions</li>\n<li>Wild animals (non-sentient) in remote areas</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Social ostracism for violating class conventions</li>\n<li>Secret police monitoring university radicals</li>\n<li>Informants in academic and social circles</li>\n<li>Witch-hunters seeking forbidden magic users</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Creatures</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bears (possibly Animals) in the forests</li>\n<li>Wolves in remote areas</li>\n<li>Grimmerie manifestations near places of power</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Random Encounters</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d12</th>\n<th>Encounter</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A Gillikinese noble traveling with guards, suspicious of strangers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>University students debating philosophy, happy to include travelers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>A maunt traveling alone, may offer sanctuary or information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-5</td>\n<td>Gale Force patrol checking papers and searching for Animal refugees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Merchants transporting purple dyes and fine fabrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>A wandering bear who may or may not be an Animal in hiding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>A wealthy family's carriage broken down, needing assistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>A witch-hunter questioning locals about magical activity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Farmers bringing goods to market, willing to trade or gossip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>An Animal refugee hiding in the woods, desperate for help</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Strange lights in the forest\u2014magic, or something else?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A professor at Shiz has disappeared after discovering something in the restricted archives.

What do they do with this knowledge?</li>\n<li>A valuable book containing dangerous magical knowledge has been stolen from Shiz University.

The region's emphasis on education and culture creates interesting roleplay opportunities, while the underlying injustice and collaboration with authoritarianism provide compelling conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>Use Gillikin to explore themes of privilege, complicity, and the responsibility of the educated. Characters may find themselves torn between the comfort of Gillikinese society and the moral imperative to resist injustice.</p>\n\n<p>The purple aesthetic can be visually striking in descriptions. Play up the contrast between the beautiful, refined surface of Gillikinese culture and the ugly realities it conceals.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese (Race)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Memory Jar",
      "content": "<h1>Memory Jar</h1>\n\n<p><em>2nd-level enchantment (Grimmerie)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"She kept her grief in a jar on the shelf, next to the dried lavender and the mouse bones. Some days she took it down and let herself remember. Most days, she was grateful to forget.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Spell Details</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>School</strong></td>\n<td>Enchantment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Casting Time</strong></td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Range</strong></td>\n<td>Touch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Components</strong></td>\n<td>V, S, M (a glass jar worth at least 10 gp)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Duration</strong></td>\n<td>Until dispelled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tradition</strong></td>\n<td>Grimmerie, Witch (Hedge)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>You touch a willing creature and extract a specific memory, storing it in a glass jar. The creature must concentrate on the memory they wish to remove while you cast this spell. The memory can be as short as a single moment or as long as one hour of continuous experience.</p>\n\n<p>Once the memory is extracted and stored in the jar, the creature no longer has any recollection of the events contained in that memory. The jar glows faintly with a color corresponding to the emotional content of the memory: warm gold for joy, deep blue for sadness, red for anger, green for envy, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>A creature can restore a memory by opening the jar and breathing in its contents (an action). The memory returns instantly and completely. Once restored, the jar becomes empty and nonmagical.</p>\n\n<p>If the jar is broken while containing a memory, the memory is lost forever and cannot be recovered by any means short of a <em>Wish</em> spell. The creature who lost the memory will never recall it, though they may be aware that something is missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can extract and store an additional hour of memories for each slot level above 2nd. These can be from the same creature or different willing creatures, but each memory requires its own jar.</p>\n\n<h2>Spell Lists</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adept</li>\n<li>Witch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Lore</h2>\n\n<p>The Memory Jar spell is ancient, predating even the Grimmerie's creation. Some scholars believe it originated with the Kumbric Witch, who is said to have stored millennia of memories in jars hidden throughout Oz. Others claim it was developed by grieving Quadling domingons who sought to ease the pain of loss.</p>\n\n<p>During the Wizard's reign, Memory Jar became a tool of oppression. Political prisoners were forced to surrender memories of resistance activities. Some were made to forget their own identities. The practice became so notorious that possession of a memory jar is now illegal in the Emerald City, punishable by imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the spell persists, used by those seeking to escape trauma, hide dangerous knowledge, or preserve precious moments. In the underground market, memory jars sell for enormous sums\u2014particularly those containing the final moments of famous individuals or lost magical knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>There are disturbing rumors of collectors who steal others' memories, building vast libraries of experiences they can browse like books. Such individuals are hunted by both the authorities and those they've victimized.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Memory Jar is a spell with profound narrative implications. Use it sparingly and thoughtfully. A character who removes a traumatic memory doesn't heal from it\u2014they simply no longer know it exists. This can lead to dangerous situations where they repeat past mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the ethical questions: Is it right to remove a memory, even a painful one? What if that memory is crucial to someone's identity? What happens when a character discovers they've had memories removed without their knowledge?</p>\n\n<p>Memory jars make excellent quest objects. The party might need to recover a stolen memory jar, protect someone's hidden memories, or decide whether to restore a memory that might destroy someone they care about.</p>\n\n<p>The spell can also be used for information storage. An Adept might extract their knowledge of a powerful spell and hide it away, ensuring it doesn't die with them but also can't be tortured out of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creative Uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing knowledge of a secret location before being captured</li>\n<li>Storing happy memories to revisit during dark times</li>\n<li>Hiding evidence of a crime</li>\n<li>Creating a false alibi (\"I don't remember where I was that night\")</li>\n<li>Preserving the memories of the dying</li>\n<li>Trading memories as currency in certain underground markets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Limitations and Considerations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The spell requires a willing subject\u2014forcing someone to forget is a different, darker magic</li>\n<li>Breaking a memory jar is permanent destruction</li>\n<li>Some memories are too large or too fundamental to identity to be removed</li>\n<li>Removing a memory doesn't remove skills or knowledge gained from it, leading to strange gaps in understanding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/memory-jar-filled', 'Memory Jar (Filled)'); return false;\">Memory Jar (Magic Item)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/oz-specific/memory-rot', 'Memory Rot'); return false;\">Memory Rot (Condition)</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Shiz Dropout",
      "content": "<h1>Shiz Dropout</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I left before they could expel me. Better to walk away than be thrown out, my father always said. He stopped saying much of anything to me after that.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>You were a student at Shiz University, the most prestigious institution of learning in all of Oz. Whether you studied for a single semester or made it nearly to graduation, something happened that ended your academic career. Perhaps you were expelled for unauthorized magical experimentation, or you discovered a truth too dangerous to ignore. Maybe you simply couldn't afford the tuition, or the politics of academic life proved too much to stomach. Whatever the reason, you left Shiz before earning your degree.</p>\n\n<p>This background carries both privilege and shame. You received enough education to set you apart from common folk, learning skills and making connections that will serve you for life. But you also bear the stigma of failure in Gillikinese society, where a Shiz education is the key to advancement. Your family may have been disappointed or furious. Your former friends may have abandoned you. Yet you've also seen behind the curtain of Oz's intellectual elite, and you know that their refinement often masks corruption and cowardice.</p>\n\n<p>Many Shiz dropouts become adventurers, using the skills they learned to make their way in a world that has closed its doors to them. Some seek to prove they were right to leave. Others hunt for redemption, hoping to finish what they started or right the wrongs that drove them away.</p>\n\n<h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2>\n\n<p>Choose two from: Arcana, History, Investigation, Persuasion</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Proficiencies</h2>\n\n<p>Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument</p>\n\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n\n<p>One of your choice (academic study)</p>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A set of fine clothes (purple-trimmed, slightly worn)</li>\n<li>A Shiz University scarf or pin (you couldn't quite bring yourself to throw it away)</li>\n<li>A letter from someone you left behind (friend, rival, or lover)</li>\n<li>One academic book from your studies</li>\n<li>A belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Feature: Academic Network</h2>\n\n<p>Despite leaving Shiz, you still have connections in academic circles throughout Oz. When you're in a settlement with a library, university, or scholarly institution, you can gain access to academic resources and seek out learned individuals who might help you\u2014for old times' sake, shared intellectual interests, or in exchange for interesting information.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you can usually identify fellow Shiz students or alumni on sight, recognizing the subtle markers of Shiz culture (speech patterns, fashion choices, mannerisms). Whether they'll be friendly or hostile depends on the circumstances and how you left, but at least you'll know you're dealing with someone from your world.</p>\n\n<h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2>\n\n<p>Shiz dropouts are shaped by their incomplete education and the circumstances of their departure. Some are bitter about what they lost. Others are relieved to be free of academic constraints. All carry the weight of unfinished business.</p>\n\n<h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I correct people's grammar and pronunciation without thinking.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I'm more comfortable with books than people.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>I name-drop my time at Shiz constantly, even though I didn't finish.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I'm suspicious of authority figures, especially academic ones.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I have a chip on my shoulder about not having a degree.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>I collect knowledge obsessively, trying to fill the gaps in my education.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>I'm surprisingly practical for someone with a Shiz background.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>I hide my Shiz past, ashamed of both the privilege and the failure.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Ideals</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Truth matters more than degrees or social standing.

      "title": "Silver Slippers",
      "content": "<h1>Silver Slippers</h1>\n\n<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Three clicks of the heels, they say, and you're home. But what if you don't know where home is anymore?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Description</h2>\n\n<p>These elegant slippers are crafted from hammered silver that somehow remains flexible and comfortable despite its metallic nature. They fit any foot that attempts to wear them, reshaping themselves instantly to provide perfect comfort. The silver has a soft sheen that catches the light, and tiny runes are etched along the straps in a language that predates modern Ozian script.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers weigh almost nothing and make no sound when walking, despite being made of metal. They never tarnish or scratch, maintaining their pristine appearance no matter how hard they're worn. When not being worn, they fold flat and can easily be tucked into a pocket or pack.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>The Silver Slippers are one of several pairs of magical shoes known to exist in Oz, though perhaps not as famous as the Ruby Slippers that once belonged to Nessarose Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the East. The origins of these silver shoes are mysterious\u2014some claim they were crafted by the Gnome King of Ev, while others believe they're a creation of Lurline herself, gifts left behind when she departed Oz.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers have passed through many hands over the centuries. They were once owned by a wealthy Gillikinese merchant who used them to build a trading empire, appearing in distant markets overnight. A Quadling resistance leader wore them during the genocide, saving dozens of refugees by transporting them to safety. Most recently, they were held in the private collection of a noble family until they were stolen\u2014or perhaps rescued\u2014by person or persons unknown.</p>\n\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n\n<h3>Swift Travel</h3>\n<p>While wearing these slippers, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you ignore difficult terrain when walking.</p>\n\n<h3>Seven-League Stride</h3>\n<p>Once per long rest, you can activate the slippers' power by clicking your heels together three times and concentrating on a location you can visualize. You must have been to this location before, or have seen it clearly in a crystal ball, scrying pool, or similar divination. When you activate this power, you teleport to that location, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space if your intended destination is blocked.</p>\n\n<p>The teleportation can cross any distance within Oz, but it cannot cross the Deadly Desert or travel to other planes of existence. If you attempt to teleport somewhere you cannot reach, the magic fails but is not expended.</p>\n\n<h3>Always Steady</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks made to avoid being knocked prone or moved against your will. Your feet find purchase where others would slip and fall.</p>\n\n<h2>Attunement</h2>\n\n<p>To attune to the Silver Slippers, you must wear them for one hour while walking a path that matters to you\u2014toward something you seek or away from something you flee. During this time, you must think about where you truly belong in the world. The slippers will attune to you if they judge you worthy, though their criteria for worthiness remain mysterious.</p>\n\n<p>Once attuned, only you can wear the slippers. They will not fit anyone else until your attunement ends.</p>\n\n<h2>Lore & Legends</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Common Knowledge:</strong> Most people in Oz have heard stories of magical shoes that can transport their wearer great distances. The tales often involve someone desperately wishing to go home and finding themselves there with three clicks of their heels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rumors:</strong> Some claim that the Silver Slippers can cross the Deadly Desert, though this has never been proven. Others whisper that wearing them draws the attention of powerful beings who covet such items. There's a persistent story that the slippers will eventually take their wearer somewhere they don't expect\u2014home, but not the home they imagined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Misconceptions:</strong> Many believe the slippers will take you anywhere you want to go with a simple wish. In truth, the magic is more limited and requires genuine knowledge of your destination. Some think the slippers are indestructible, but they can be damaged or destroyed like any magical item\u2014it's simply very difficult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>True Secrets:</strong> The Silver Slippers were created by Lurline as a fail-safe, intended to allow her chosen champions to retreat from danger or reach places of power quickly. They respond not just to where you want to go, but to where you need to be. On rare occasions, the slippers have taken their wearers somewhere other than their intended destination, always to a place where they were desperately needed\u2014or where they needed to be for their own growth.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers also have a defensive property that few discover: if someone attempts to forcibly remove them from an attuned wearer, the slippers teleport both the wearer and themselves to a place the wearer thinks of as safe.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Silver Slippers are powerful but not game-breaking. The once-per-long-rest teleportation is significant but limited, making it a strategic resource rather than a constant escape hatch. Use the slippers to enable dramatic moments\u2014rescues, last-second escapes, or surprise appearances.</p>\n\n<p>Consider having the slippers' teleportation be imperfect in interesting ways. Perhaps the wearer arrives at their destination exhausted, or the magic attracts attention. Maybe crossing certain magical boundaries (like the wards around Kiamo Ko or the Emerald City) requires a saving throw or causes complications.</p>\n\n<p>The slippers work well as a quest reward or a contested object. Multiple factions might want them, leading to interesting choices for the party. Do they keep them, sell them, give them to someone in need, or destroy them to keep them out of dangerous hands?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Versions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Silver Slippers (Rare):</strong> Can teleport twice per long rest and grant a +1 bonus to AC</li>\n<li><strong>Tarnished Silver Slippers (Common):</strong> Only grant the Swift Travel property, no teleportation</li>\n<li><strong>Silver Dancing Shoes (Uncommon):</strong> Focus on movement in combat, granting extra movement and the ability to disengage as a bonus action</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/ruby-slippers', 'Ruby Slippers'); return false;\">Ruby Slippers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/nessarose-thropp', 'Nessarose Thropp'); return false;\">Nessarose Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/rare/emerald-city-shoes', 'Emerald City Shoes'); return false;\">Emerald City Shoes</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "The Gale Force",
      "content": "<h1>The Gale Force</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"We serve Oz. That's what they tell us, and we repeat it until we believe it. But who is Oz? The Palace? The Emperor? The Emerald City that wouldn't exist without us keeping order in the provinces? Serve Oz long enough, and you stop asking questions like that.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is the military arm of the Ozian government, serving as both army and internal security force. Established during the Wizard's reign and expanded dramatically under Emperor Shell, the Gale Force maintains order throughout Oz\u2014or imposes it, depending on your perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Named for Dorothy Gale, the outsider whose arrival precipitated the Wizard's fall, the Gale Force represents Oz's attempt to control the chaos that followed. They are soldiers, police, border guards, and enforcers. In the Emerald City, they maintain a visible but relatively restrained presence. In the provinces, particularly Munchkinland and Quadling Country, they are an occupying force.</p>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is complicated. Most soldiers are ordinary people trying to make a living and maintain order. Some genuinely believe they're protecting Oz from chaos and external threats. Others are just following orders, too afraid or too indoctrinated to question them. And some\u2014a terrifying minority\u2014have found that the Gale Force gives them power over others, and they enjoy wielding it.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<h3>Primary Goal</h3>\n<p>Maintain the stability and territorial integrity of Oz under the authority of the Palace, currently Emperor Shell's government. This includes suppressing rebellion, controlling borders, enforcing laws, and protecting Ozian interests.</p>\n\n<h3>Secondary Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enforce Animal registration and control policies</li>\n<li>Suppress the Munchkinland independence movement and maintain Ozian authority in contested territories</li>\n<li>Monitor and control the practice of unauthorized magic</li>\n<li>Protect trade routes and economic interests</li>\n<li>Gather intelligence on threats to the state</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Hidden Agenda</h3>\n<p>The highest levels of the Gale Force are aware that Emperor Shell's grip on power is tenuous. They are preparing contingencies for potential succession crises, civil war, or the complete collapse of central authority. Some commanders have already begun establishing personal power bases, ensuring that if Oz falls apart, they'll control whatever comes next.</p>\n\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n\n<h3>Leadership</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force is commanded by the Lord General, who reports directly to the Palace. Below the Lord General are four Regional Commanders, each responsible for operations in one of the four provinces. The Emerald City garrison has its own commander who holds equivalent rank to the Regional Commanders.</p>\n\n<h3>Hierarchy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lord General</strong> - Overall commander</li>\n<li><strong>Regional Commander</strong> - Province-level command</li>\n<li><strong>Colonel</strong> - Commands multiple battalions</li>\n<li><strong>Major</strong> - Commands a battalion (400-600 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Captain</strong> - Commands a company (100-150 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong> - Second-in-command of a company</li>\n<li><strong>Sergeant</strong> - Commands a squad (10-15 soldiers)</li>\n<li><strong>Corporal</strong> - Assists sergeants</li>\n<li><strong>Private</strong> - Enlisted soldier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Special units (Dragon Corps, Animal Processing Division, Intelligence) have parallel command structures with their own specialized ranks.</p>\n\n<h3>Membership</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force recruits through a combination of voluntary enlistment and conscription. Enlistment offers steady pay, training, and social status\u2014valuable in a uncertain economy. Conscription targets young men from the provinces, particularly from families unable to pay the exemption fee.</p>\n\n<p>Total strength is estimated at 25,000-30,000 soldiers, though exact numbers are classified. The war with Free Munchkinland has strained these numbers, leading to increased conscription and retention of soldiers past their service terms.</p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<h3>Financial</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force consumes approximately 40% of the Ozian government's budget. Funding comes from taxation, tariffs, confiscation of property from enemies of the state, and the sale of goods produced in prison labor camps. Recent war expenses have strained these resources, leading to delayed pay and supply shortages in some units.</p>\n\n<h3>Military</h3>\n<p>Standard infantry armament includes crossbows, swords, pikes, and medium armor. Cavalry units are small but effective. Special units include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dragon Corps</strong> - Soldiers who ride or direct dragons in combat (highly dangerous, high casualties)</li>\n<li><strong>Siege Engineers</strong> - Specialists in fortification and breaking fortifications</li>\n<li><strong>Witch Hunters</strong> - Trained to combat magical threats</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Intelligence</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force maintains an extensive network of informants throughout Oz. They monitor suspicious activity, infiltrate resistance groups, and report on public sentiment. This intelligence apparatus works closely with the Menaciers, Emperor Shell's secret police, though there is significant rivalry between the two organizations.</p>\n\n<h3>Magical</h3>\n<p>Limited. The Gale Force employs a small number of Adepts and Unionists for magical support, but Emperor Shell distrusts magic and has kept these numbers deliberately low. Access to magical items is restricted to officers and special units. The Dragon Corps represents the most significant magical asset, though controlling dragons is as dangerous to the Gale Force as to their enemies.</p>\n\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force's political influence is substantial. Many officers are from Gillikinese aristocratic families, creating connections between military and civilian power. In the provinces, Gale Force commanders often have more practical authority than civilian administrators. However, Emperor Shell has carefully prevented the military from becoming too independent, maintaining rival power centers to keep them in check.</p>\n\n<h2>Notable Members</h2>\n\n<h3>Commander Cherrystone - Regional Commander, Munchkinland</h3>\n<p>A career soldier who rose through the ranks on merit. Cherrystone is efficient, disciplined, and capable of great cruelty in service to what he sees as duty. He genuinely believes the Munchkinland independence movement threatens Oz's survival and has prosecuted the war with ruthless determination. His effectiveness makes him valuable; his methods make him controversial even within the Gale Force.</p>\n\n<h3>Captain Trism bon Cavalish - Intelligence Officer</h3>\n<p>A young officer from a minor aristocratic family, Trism is intelligent and increasingly troubled by what he's been ordered to do. He's seen Animal families torn apart, witnessed interrogations, and carried out orders he knows are wrong. He hasn't acted on his doubts yet, but he's a man in crisis\u2014which makes him both a potential ally and a security risk.</p>\n\n<h3>Sergeant Kells - Veteran Enlisted</h3>\n<p>Twenty years in the Gale Force has made Kells cynical but competent. She keeps her head down, follows orders, and gets her squad through their assignments with minimal casualties. She doesn't ask questions about the bigger picture because she learned long ago that questions only bring trouble. Her soldiers respect her because she keeps them alive, not because she's inspiring.</p>\n\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n\n<h3>Allies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Palace:</strong> The Gale Force serves the government, though the relationship is more transactional than ideological for many soldiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Unionist Church (Orthodox):</strong> The Church provides moral authority and chaplains for the Gale Force. In return, the military protects Church interests and enforces religious law.</li>\n<li><strong>Gillikinese Aristocracy:</strong> Many officers are from noble families, creating natural alliances with the ruling class.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Rivals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Menaciers:</strong> Shell's secret police compete with the Gale Force for funding, influence, and the Emperor's favor. Both organizations spy on each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Provincial Governments:</strong> Local administrators resent military interference in civilian matters, while the Gale Force views civilians as soft and ineffective.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Enemies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free Munchkinland Forces:</strong> Open warfare in the east, with atrocities committed on both sides.</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Resistance:</strong> The Gale Force's enforcement of Animal registration makes them the primary enemy of Animal rights activists.</li>\n<li><strong>Quadling Guerrillas:</strong> Insurgents in the south wage a slow-burn war against Gale Force occupation.</li>\n<li><strong>Various Resistance Groups:</strong> Anyone opposing the government views the Gale Force as the fist of oppression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Presence in Oz</h2>\n\n<h3>Headquarters</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force command is based in the Palace District of the Emerald City, in a fortress-like complex that also houses training facilities, armories, and administrative offices.</p>\n\n<h3>Territory</h3>\n<p>The Gale Force maintains bases, outposts, and patrols throughout Oz. Their presence is heaviest in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Munchkinland:</strong> Occupation forces engaged in active warfare</li>\n<li><strong>Quadling Country:</strong> Garrison forces maintaining control over a resentful population</li>\n<li><strong>Major Trade Routes:</strong> Protection against bandits and smugglers</li>\n<li><strong>Border Regions:</strong> Preventing unauthorized crossings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Operations</h3>\n<p>Day-to-day activities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patrols and checkpoints</li>\n<li>Enforcing Animal registration</li>\n<li>Hunting fugitives and rebels</li>\n<li>Protecting government installations</li>\n<li>Conducting raids on suspected resistance safe houses</li>\n<li>Escorting government officials and valuable shipments</li>\n<li>Training new recruits</li>\n<li>Combat operations in Munchkinland</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Joining the Gale Force</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Physically capable, no history of treason or serious crime, loyalty to Oz (as tested by officers who may themselves be unreliable)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Process:</strong> Enlistment involves an oath ceremony, basic training (three months), and assignment to a unit. Officers are typically drawn from the aristocracy or promoted from enlisted ranks after proving themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steady pay (when the government has funds)</li>\n<li>Food, shelter, and equipment provided</li>\n<li>Social status (in some communities)</li>\n<li>Skills training</li>\n<li>Access to military courts (separate from civilian justice)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Obligations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow all orders from superior officers</li>\n<li>Minimum service term (typically 4 years, extended during wartime)</li>\n<li>Subject to military law and discipline</li>\n<li>Can be assigned anywhere in Oz</li>\n<li>Expected to enforce all government policies, including those regarding Animals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ranks and Advancement:</strong> Promotion is based on time in service, performance, connections, and (increasingly) willingness to do unpleasant work. Officers from aristocratic backgrounds advance faster. Enlisted soldiers can reach sergeant through competence; further promotion is rare without patronage.</p>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A Gale Force officer approaches the party with evidence that their commander is selling military supplies on the black market. Helping them could make powerful enemies\u2014or allies.</li>\n<li>The party witnesses the Gale Force preparing to raid an Animal safe house. Do they intervene, warn the Animals, or look the other way?</li>\n<li>A deserter from the Gale Force begs the party for help escaping Oz. They carry secrets that could damage the government\u2014if they survive long enough to share them.</li>\n<li>The party is conscripted into the Gale Force and must complete their service term (or find a way out) while navigating military politics and moral dilemmas.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>The Gale Force should be complex, not cartoonishly evil. They're people doing a job in a broken system. Some are true believers, some are opportunists, most are just trying to survive. Use them to explore themes of complicity, duty versus morality, and the banality of evil.</p>\n\n<p>Individual soldiers can be allies, enemies, or anything in between. A Gale Force patrol might let the party go with a warning, share information about threats ahead, or turn a blind eye to small infractions. This makes encounters with them tense and unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the psychological toll of service. Soldiers who've enforced Animal registration or fought in Munchkinland carry trauma. Some drink too much, some have nightmares, some have stopped feeling anything. These human details make them more than just obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>The Gale Force is also an opportunity for redemption arcs. A soldier who begins to question their orders can become a powerful ally, bringing inside knowledge and resources to the resistance\u2014at tremendous personal cost.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-menaciers', 'The Menaciers'); return false;\">The Menaciers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/free-munchkinland', 'Free Munchkinland'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Elphaba Thropp",
      "content": "<h1>Elphaba Thropp</h1>\n\n<p><em>Munchkinlander Human, Adept (Reader) 18, Chaotic Good (or Neutral Good, or just Chaotic)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I'm wicked through and through, they say. But I've never made someone disappear who didn't threaten Animals first. I've never tortured confessions or drained marshes or Silenced anyone. So who, exactly, is wicked?\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>At a Glance</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Revolutionary, Witch, Symbol of Resistance (depending on era and perspective)</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Kiamo Ko (in later life), various locations during her activist years, deceased by the time of most campaigns (but her legacy endures)</p>\n<p><strong>Attitude:</strong> Hostile to authority, protective of the oppressed, deeply distrustful but capable of fierce loyalty to those she loves</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba's most striking feature is her green skin\u2014a deep emerald that caused her mother to scream when she was born. Her eyes are dark and intense, her hair black and wild. She is tall and angular, with sharp features that some find harsh and others find compelling. In her youth, she dressed practically, favoring dark colors that didn't show dirt. Later, she embraced the pointed hat and dramatic black clothing that people expected from the \"Wicked Witch.\"</p>\n\n<p>She moves with purpose and energy, often seeming to take up more space than her physical form suggests. When angry or casting magic, her green skin seems to darken and her eyes flash. In rare moments of peace, her face softens, revealing the person she might have been in a kinder world.</p>\n\n<p>She has an aversion to water\u2014it pains her skin, making bathing difficult and rain miserable. This has contributed to her reputation for uncleanliness, though in truth she's meticulous about hygiene within the limits her condition allows.</p>\n\n<h2>Personality</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba is brilliant, passionate, and profoundly angry at injustice. She cannot look away from suffering, even when doing so would be easier or safer. This moral clarity is both her greatest strength and her fatal flaw\u2014she will sacrifice anything, including herself, for what she believes is right.</p>\n\n<p>She is not easy to like. She's prickly, judgmental, and often fails to understand social niceties. She says what she thinks without cushioning it, and she has little patience for those who prioritize comfort over justice. Yet those who earn her trust discover a fierce friend capable of great tenderness, particularly toward Animals, children, and the marginalized.</p>\n\n<p>Her relationship with power is complex. She craves the ability to change things, but she despises authority and those who wield it selfishly. The Grimmerie offers her tremendous power, but reading it is slowly destroying her. She knows this and does it anyway, because what else can she do in the face of such overwhelming evil?</p>\n\n<p>Underneath the anger is tremendous pain. She's lonely, convinced she's unlovable because of her green skin. She's mourning\u2014for Dr. Dillamond, for Fiyero, for all the Animals who've suffered, for the person she might have been. She's also consumed by guilt over the things she's done, the people she's hurt, the moral lines she's crossed.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>Born to Frex, a Unionist minister, and Melena Thropp in Munchkinland's Rush Margins, Elphaba's green skin marked her as different from birth. Her father saw her as punishment for his wife's sins. Her mother drowned her sorrows in wine and fantasy. Only her nanny, Nanny, showed her affection.</p>\n\n<p>At Shiz University, Elphaba studied sorcery under Madame Morrible while pursuing a degree in life sciences. She befriended (and was changed by) Dr. Dillamond, a Goat professor whose research into Animal consciousness was deemed dangerous by the authorities. His murder radicalized her, setting her on a path of resistance against the Wizard's regime.</p>\n\n<p>Her complicated relationship with Glinda Upland\u2014roommate, friend, rival, and perhaps something more\u2014shaped both their lives. Where Elphaba chose resistance, Glinda chose accommodation, becoming \"Glinda the Good\" and working within the system. Their divergent paths haunt them both.</p>\n\n<p>Elphaba's affair with Fiyero, an Arjiki prince, gave her one of the few genuine connections of her life. His apparent death devastated her, though rumors persist that she saved him through magic at a terrible cost.</p>\n\n<p>In her later years, she retreated to Kiamo Ko in the Vinkus, raising Fiyero's children and studying the Grimmerie. She became the Wicked Witch of the West in truth, though whether she was wicked or simply desperate remains a matter of perspective. Her apparent death at Dorothy Gale's hands became myth, but like everything about Elphaba, the truth is more complicated.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals & Motivations</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Current Goals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect Animals from persecution and restore their rights</li>\n<li>Understand and master the Grimmerie's magic, despite the cost</li>\n<li>Undermine the Wizard's (later the Emperor's) authority</li>\n<li>Keep those she loves safe, even if it means pushing them away</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Long-term Ambitions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overthrow the corrupt government and establish a just society</li>\n<li>Uncover the truth about Oz's history and the sources of magic</li>\n<li>Prove that she is not wicked, or at least that wickedness is more complex than good and evil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Fears:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure\u2014that all her sacrifices will accomplish nothing</li>\n<li>That she really is wicked, that power has corrupted her as it corrupts everyone</li>\n<li>Water, which burns her skin</li>\n<li>Losing those few people she loves</li>\n<li>That the Grimmerie will consume her before she can finish her work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Elphaba Thropp</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Voice & Manner:</strong> Sharp, precise, often sarcastic. She speaks quickly when passionate, which is often. Her voice can be harsh, but it can also be gentle with those she trusts. She has a tendency to lecture when she feels strongly about something.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quirks:</strong> Avoids water compulsively. Touches her hat when nervous. Quotes Dr. Dillamond frequently.

Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following Adept spells prepared:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cantrips (at will): <em>Green-Light, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost</em></li>\n<li>1st level (4 slots): <em>Detect Magic, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield</em></li>\n<li>2nd level (3 slots): <em>Levitate, Memory Jar, Invisibility</em></li>\n<li>3rd level (3 slots): <em>Counterspell, Fly, Dispel Magic</em></li>\n<li>4th level (3 slots): <em>Polymorph, Greater Invisibility, Banishment</em></li>\n<li>5th level (3 slots): <em>Telekinesis, Wall of Force, Dominate Person</em></li>\n<li>6th level (1 slot): <em>Globe of Invulnerability, Chain Lightning</em></li>\n<li>7th level (1 slot): <em>Reverse Gravity, Teleport</em></li>\n<li>8th level (1 slot): <em>Demiplane, Power Word Stun</em></li>\n<li>9th level (1 slot): <em>Time Stop, Wish (extremely rare, dangerous)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Grimmerie Corruption.</em></strong> Elphaba has read deeply from the Grimmerie. She can cast any spell she knows at one level higher without using a higher-level slot, but when she does, she takes 1d6 necrotic damage per spell level. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Water Vulnerability.</em></strong> Contact with water deals 1d4 acid damage per round to Elphaba. Full immersion would be lethal. She cannot swim and avoids rain when possible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Witch-Mark.</em></strong> Elphaba's green skin makes her instantly recognizable and grants her advantage on Intimidation checks against those who fear magic, but disadvantage on Persuasion checks with most people.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Grimmerie Blast.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 5) force damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Flying Monkeys.</em></strong> Once per day, if Elphaba possesses the Golden Cap, she can summon 2d6 flying monkeys to serve her for one hour.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Shield.</em></strong> When hit by an attack, Elphaba can cast <em>Shield</em> as a reaction, increasing her AC by 5 until the start of her next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Counterspell.</em></strong> When a creature within 60 feet casts a spell, Elphaba can attempt to counter it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Quest Hooks</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Quests She Might Offer:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"I need you to smuggle this family of Animal refugees to safety. The Gale Force is hunting them, and I can't be seen helping\u2014it would endanger too many others.\"</li>\n<li>\"There's a Grimmerie fragment in the Emerald City archives. Get it for me before it falls into the wrong hands. I'll teach you a spell in exchange.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Quests Involving Her:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The party is hired to hunt \"the Wicked Witch of the West.\" When they find her, they discover she's protecting Animal orphans from the Gale Force. What do they do?</li>\n<li>Elphaba appears to the party in a time of crisis, offering help\u2014but accepting it means making an enemy of the government. Her aid comes with consequences.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Glinda Upland:</strong> Former roommate and complicated friend. They haven't spoken in years, but each thinks of the other often. Love, resentment, regret, and understanding all tangled together.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiyero:</strong> Her great love, whose fate is uncertain. She either mourns him or has saved him in a way that makes their relationship impossible.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wizard/Emperor Shell:</strong> Her enemy, the embodiment of corrupt authority</li>\n<li><strong>Dr. Dillamond:</strong> Dead mentor whose murder set her on this path. She carries his watch.</li>\n<li><strong>Madame Morrible:</strong> Former teacher turned enemy, manipulator who used her</li>\n<li><strong>Nessarose (sister):</strong> Complicated relationship, guilt over her sister's fate</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Resistance:</strong> Ally and sometimes leader, though she works mostly alone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Elphaba is one of Oz's most significant figures, but use her carefully. She can overshadow player characters if overused. Consider these approaches:</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Legend:</strong> She's already dead by the campaign's start, but her legacy shapes everything. The party encounters people she saved, those she hurt, places she marked, and the ongoing consequences of her choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Distant Ally:</strong> She helps the party indirectly\u2014leaving information, creating diversions, sending messages through intermediaries. They know she exists but rarely meet her.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Moral Center:</strong> The party encounters her once or twice at crucial moments. She challenges their assumptions, asks difficult questions, and forces them to consider what they're willing to sacrifice for justice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Antagonist:</strong> If your campaign is from the government's perspective or explores moral ambiguity, Elphaba can be an opponent. She's not evil, but her methods are extreme, and her attacks on government facilities endanger innocent people.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that Elphaba is a person, not a symbol. She makes mistakes, hurts people she loves, and sometimes chooses poorly. She's consumed by her cause in ways that aren't always healthy. She can be wrong. This complexity makes her compelling.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/kiamo-ko', 'Kiamo Ko'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/glinda-upland', 'Glinda Upland'); return false;\">Glinda Upland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a></li>\n</ul>",

But we work the land that feeds all of Oz, and that makes us bigger than any Emperor.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Munchkinlanders are the agricultural heart of Oz, dwelling in the eastern province where blue-tinted farms and villages stretch across rolling hills. Known for their shorter stature, strong work ethic, and deep connection to the land, Munchkinlanders have endured centuries of exploitation, occupation, and dismissal by the other provinces\u2014yet they persist.</p>\n\n<p>Munchkinland's history is one of oppression and resilience. They suffered under the tyrannical rule of Nessarose, the Wicked Witch of the East, whose religious zealotry and iron control crushed the spirit of many communities. The Ruby Slippers she enchanted became symbols of her power and their subjugation. When Dorothy's house fell on Nessarose, the Munchkinlanders' celebration was genuine\u2014if short-lived.</p>\n\n<p>In more recent times, Munchkinland has become a flashpoint for revolution. The Free Munchkinland Movement seeks complete independence from the Emerald City, leading to civil war. Munchkinlanders now find themselves divided: some fight for freedom, others collaborate with Imperial forces, and many simply try to survive in contested territory. This makes Munchkinlander characters deeply political, whether they wish to be or not.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Constitution score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Munchkinlanders mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small.

You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion and against effects that would reduce your hit point maximum. Additionally, you can go twice as long without food and water before suffering the effects of starvation or thirst.</p>\n\n<h3>Land's Blessing</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Nature) check related to crops, agriculture, or farming, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>\n\n<h3>Munchkin Resilience</h3>\n<p>Munchkinlanders have survived tyranny, occupation, and war. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Munchkinland is divided into several distinct cultural groups:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eminent Families:</strong> The old money of Munchkinland, these families hold vast estates and have historically collaborated with whoever held power in the Emerald City. They dress in fine blue silks and often speak with affected accents. Many supported Nessarose's rule and now find themselves targets of revolutionary sentiment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Farming Class:</strong> The backbone of Munchkinland, these communities work the grain fields, orchards, and vegetable farms that feed all of Oz. They live in small villages, celebrate harvest festivals, and maintain traditions passed down through generations. The revolution draws much of its support from these communities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rush Margins Dwellers:</strong> Living in the remote wetlands where Munchkinland meets Quadling Country, these Munchkinlanders are isolated, superstitious, and fiercely independent. The Thropp family originates from Rush Margins, giving the area a dark reputation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Free Munchkinland Loyalists:</strong> Since the secession, a new identity has emerged. These Munchkinlanders fly the blue flag of independence, train in revolutionary militias, and believe passionately in self-determination. \"Munchkinland for Munchkinlanders\" is their rallying cry.</p>\n\n<h2>Divided Land</h2>\n\n<p>The war has split families, destroyed villages, and forced every Munchkinlander to choose sides\u2014or try desperately not to. Gale Force checkpoints dot the countryside. Revolutionary cells hide in barns. Brother fights brother. The blue of Munchkinland is stained with blood.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Boq, Nib, Rone, Crope, Krill, Farner</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Nessarose, Milla, Ama Clutch, Melena, Preen</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Thropp, Clutch, Rushby, Grainsower, Orchard, Bluefield, Cornstack</p>\n\n<p>Farming families often take names related to their trade or land. Revolutionary families sometimes adopt new surnames to hide from Imperial forces.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Munchkinlander</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I never waste food; waste is sinful when others go hungry.</li>\n<li>I judge people by their work ethic, not their words.</li>\n<li>I'm suspicious of authority figures, especially from the Emerald City.</li>\n<li>I have a deep love for the land and can't sleep well indoors in cities.</li>\n<li>I speak plainly and distrust elaborate speech.</li>\n<li>I remember every slight and every kindness in equal measure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Independence:</strong> We deserve to govern ourselves without interference. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> We survive by working together and helping our neighbors. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition:</strong> The old ways kept us alive through dark times. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> They've stepped on us for too long. Time to fight back. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> I'll side with whoever lets my family survive. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Revolution:</strong> Burn it all down and build something new. (Chaotic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's farm has been in our line for ten generations. I'll die before I lose it.</li>\n<li>I lost someone to Nessarose's tyranny; I'll never forgive religious fanatics.</li>\n<li>The revolution killed my brother. I'll never forgive the rebels.</li>\n<li>I was there when Dorothy's house fell. I know the truth of what happened.</li>\n<li>My village was burned by [Gale Force / Free Munchkinland forces]. I seek justice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't hide my contempt for city folk and their \"refined\" ways.</li>\n<li>I'm so stubborn that I'll stick to a failing plan rather than admit I was wrong.</li>\n<li>I hold grudges for years, even against people trying to make amends.</li>\n<li>I drink too much when I'm stressed, which is often lately.</li>\n<li>I assume everyone from Gillikin is an entitled snob.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Eminent Family Munchkinlander</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Farmer's Endurance</strong> with <strong>Noble Bearing:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Additionally, you can add double your proficiency bonus to Charisma checks made to interact with other Munchkinland nobility.</p>\n\n<h3>Rush Margins Munchkinlander</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Land's Blessing</strong> with <strong>Marsh-Born:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill and ignore difficult terrain in swamps and wetlands. You also have advantage on saving throws against diseases.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Munchkinlander characters provide excellent opportunities to explore themes of revolution, loyalty, and identity. Consider these plot hooks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A character's family is divided by the war, forcing them to choose between blood and beliefs.</li>\n<li>The party discovers evidence that could shift the balance of power in the conflict.</li>\n<li>A character returns home to find their village has switched allegiances\u2014or been destroyed.</li>\n<li>Nessarose's legacy surfaces in unexpected ways (hidden caches of her magic, loyalists who remember her fondly, etc.).</li>\n<li>The Ruby Slippers resurface, and both sides want them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Remember that not every Munchkinlander is political. Many simply want to farm, raise families, and live in peace. The tragedy is that war makes neutrality nearly impossible.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/munchkinland', 'Munchkinland'); return false;\">Munchkinland (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/free-munchkinland-movement', 'Free Munchkinland Movement'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland Movement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/colwen-grounds', 'Colwen Grounds'); return false;\">Colwen Grounds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/nessarose-thropp', 'Nessarose Thropp'); return false;\">Nessarose Thropp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/free-munchkinland-revolutionary', 'Free Munchkinland Revolutionary'); return false;\">Free Munchkinland Revolutionary (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/loyal-oz-patriot', 'Loyal Oz Patriot'); return false;\">Loyal Oz Patriot (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/ruby-slippers', 'The Ruby Slippers'); return false;\">The Ruby Slippers</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<h1>Quadling</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The marshes remember. The water remembers. We remember. And one day, Oz will answer for what was done to us.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Quadlings are the survivors of genocide. Once the peaceful inhabitants of the southern marshlands, they were systematically displaced, murdered, and culturally destroyed by the Wizard's regime in the name of \"progress.\" The drainage of the Quadling marshes to build ruby mines and agricultural projects killed thousands. Those who survived were scattered, their traditional ways suppressed, their voices silenced.</p>\n\n<p>Quadling culture before the genocide was rich with spiritual traditions, particularly the Domingon practice\u2014a form of mediumship and trance work that connected practitioners with ancestors and the spirits of the marsh. The Quadlings worked with the land rather than against it, living in harmony with the wetlands. Their red-toned skin and dark hair marked them as different, making them easy targets for discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>Today's Quadlings are a people torn between erasure and remembrance. Some have assimilated into Emerald City life, hiding their heritage to avoid persecution. Others maintain communities in the remaining marshes, preserving what traditions they can. Still others have joined the resistance, determined that Oz will never forget what was done to their people. Quadling characters carry immense trauma and resilience in equal measure.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Quadlings mature at the same rate as other humans and live less than a century, though marsh-born Quadlings sometimes claim extended lifespans.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium.

Many older Quadlings refuse to speak Common in private.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Marsh Walker</h3>\n<p>You have lived in difficult terrain your entire life. You ignore difficult terrain created by water, mud, or marsh conditions. Additionally, you can hold your breath for twice as long as normal, and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat or humidity.</p>\n\n<h3>Survivor's Insight</h3>\n<p>Your people have learned to read danger and deception. You gain proficiency in the Insight skill. If you are already proficient in Insight, you instead gain proficiency in Perception or Survival.</p>\n\n<h3>Memory of Suffering</h3>\n<p>Quadlings carry generational trauma but also generational strength. When you or an ally you can see within 30 feet takes damage that would reduce them to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to grant them temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Quadling culture has fractured into several groups, each dealing with genocide differently:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marsh-Born (Traditional):</strong> These Quadlings still live in the remaining wetlands, practicing Domingon traditions, speaking Quadling, and maintaining the old ways. They are deeply spiritual, distrustful of outsiders, and determined to preserve what fragments of their culture survive. They often serve as the heart of Quadling resistance movements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Displaced/Refugee:</strong> Forced from their homes by drainage projects and military violence, these Quadlings live in makeshift communities on the edges of other provinces. They face discrimination, poverty, and constant harassment from authorities. Many work in the worst jobs for the lowest pay, invisible and exploited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>City-Assimilated:</strong> Some Quadlings have moved to the Emerald City and other urban centers, adopting non-Quadling names, dress, and customs to avoid persecution. This assimilation is a survival strategy but comes at the cost of cultural identity. Many struggle with guilt and disconnection from their heritage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resistance-Aligned:</strong> These Quadlings have taken up arms or joined underground movements dedicated to bringing down the system that destroyed their people. Some work with the Animal resistance, others form their own cells. They are often the most militant voices in opposition movements, and many view violence as justified revenge.</p>\n\n<h2>The Domingon Tradition</h2>\n\n<p>Central to Quadling spirituality is Domingon\u2014a practice of entering trance states to communicate with ancestors, spirits, and the marsh itself. Dominigons (practitioners) use meditation, chanting, and sometimes mild hallucinogens to achieve these states. The practice was heavily suppressed but has seen a quiet resurgence among traditional communities.</p>\n\n<p>Candle, mother of Rain, is perhaps the most famous modern Domingon. Her healing abilities and spiritual insights made her a figure of hope for many Quadlings.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Red, Reed, Marsh, Cypress, Murk</p>\n\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Candle, Ember, Ruby, Quell, Sedge</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Marshborn, Waterwalker, Redclay, Stillwater, Reedhand</p>\n\n<p>Traditional Quadling names often reference the marsh environment. Assimilated Quadlings sometimes adopt \"Ozian-sounding\" names to hide their heritage.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Quadling</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I speak softly, but my words carry the weight of my ancestors.</li>\n<li>I never waste anything; everything can be reused or repurposed.</li>\n<li>I'm more comfortable in silence than in conversation.</li>\n<li>I watch and listen far more than I speak.</li>\n<li>I carry small objects from home as reminders of who I am.</li>\n<li>I refuse to apologize for taking up space or existing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remembrance:</strong> The dead deserve to be remembered, and their stories must be told. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Justice:</strong> Those who committed atrocities must answer for their crimes. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> I will do whatever it takes to ensure my people endure. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> They destroyed us. I will destroy them. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Healing:</strong> We must rebuild what was broken, not perpetuate the cycle of violence. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition:</strong> Our ways are sacred and must be preserved at all costs. (Lawful)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My grandmother taught me the old songs before she died. I'm the last who knows them.</li>\n<li>I'm searching for my family, scattered during the displacement.</li>\n<li>The marsh where I was born is now a ruby mine. One day I'll reclaim it.</li>\n<li>A friend gave their life to save mine during the genocide. I owe them everything.</li>\n<li>I carry a vial of marsh water from home. If I lose it, I lose myself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't forgive, and I can't forget. Ever.</li>\n<li>I assume all Emerald City natives are complicit in genocide.</li>\n<li>I'm so traumatized that loud noises or sudden movements trigger panic.</li>\n<li>I hoard resources compulsively, fearing scarcity.</li>\n<li>I push away people who try to help, certain they'll betray me eventually.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Domingon-Trained Quadling</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Survivor's Insight</strong> with <strong>Trance Walker:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Domingon Trance special skill (see <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon Trance</a>). Additionally, you know the <em>spare the dying</em> cantrip. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p>\n\n<h3>City-Assimilated Quadling</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Marsh Walker</strong> with <strong>Hidden Heritage:</strong> You gain proficiency in Deception and advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to conceal your Quadling heritage. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Quadling characters bring heavy themes to the table\u2014genocide, cultural destruction, systemic oppression, and trauma. Discuss with your players about comfort levels with these themes.

We think them fools for trading freedom for green glass.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Vinkans are the tribal peoples of the Vinkus, the vast western plains and mountains of Oz. Fiercely independent, culturally distinct, and resistant to central authority, the Vinkans have maintained their traditional ways despite centuries of pressure from the Emerald City. The yellow-toned landscape of the Vinkus has shaped a people who value strength, honor, and autonomy above all.</p>\n\n<p>Vinkan culture is not monolithic. Several major tribes\u2014each with distinct traditions, territories, and customs\u2014coexist in complex political relationships. The Arjiki are the most prominent, known for their matrilineal society and warrior traditions. The Scrow are their traditional rivals, with different marriage customs and territorial claims. The Yunamata dwell in the marsh-edges where the Vinkus meets Quadling Country, blending elements of both cultures. Lowlander-touched Vinkans have adopted some aspects of eastern civilization, creating hybrid identities.</p>\n\n<p>Kiamo Ko, the great castle that overlooks the Thousand Year Grasslands, has been a Vinkan stronghold for generations. It became famous (or infamous) as the refuge of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who married into the Arjiki royal line through Fiyero. Her time there and the conflicts that followed have made the Vinkus a place of legend and tragedy.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Strength score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Vinkans mature slightly faster than other humans, reaching adulthood at 14-15, and live into their 70s or 80s.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium.

You ignore difficult terrain in grasslands and hills. Additionally, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Perception, or Survival.</p>\n\n<h3>Tribal Weapon Training</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency with the spear, javelin, longbow, and one martial melee weapon of your choice, reflecting your people's warrior traditions.</p>\n\n<h3>Vinkus Resilience</h3>\n<p>Life in the harsh western lands has toughened you. You have advantage on saving throws against extreme weather conditions (heat, cold, wind). Additionally, you can function on one less hour of sleep per night without penalty.</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Vinkan culture varies significantly by tribe:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki:</strong> The most prominent Vinkan tribe, the Arjiki are matrilineal\u2014lineage and inheritance pass through the mother's line. Women hold positions of power, and the chieftess's word is law. Arjiki are known for their horsemanship, elaborate face paint, and warrior traditions. They value honor, direct speech, and physical prowess. Fiyero Tigelaar, consort to Elphaba, was an Arjiki prince.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scrow:</strong> Traditional rivals of the Arjiki, the Scrow follow patrilineal customs and have different territorial claims. Border skirmishes between Arjiki and Scrow have been common for generations, though rarely escalating to full war. The Scrow use bone and leather armor decorated with feathers and practice different spiritual traditions than the Arjiki.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yunamata:</strong> Living at the edge of the marshlands where the Vinkus meets Quadling Country, the Yunamata have absorbed elements of both cultures. They are skilled at navigating both grassland and wetland, and often serve as intermediaries in trade. They are considered \"liminal\" by both Vinkans and Quadlings\u2014belonging fully to neither.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mixed/Lowlander-Touched:</strong> Some Vinkans have spent time in the eastern provinces, learned to read and write Ozian script, adopted lowlander clothing or customs, or married into non-Vinkan families. They often face suspicion from traditional Vinkans while never being fully accepted by lowlanders. They walk between worlds.</p>\n\n<h2>Kiamo Ko and the Witch</h2>\n\n<p>The castle of Kiamo Ko has defined Vinkan history in recent generations. When Fiyero brought Elphaba there as his consort, it set off a chain of events that brought war to the Vinkus. The Wizard's forces attacked the castle. Dragons were unleashed. Fiyero himself disappeared, possibly transformed by Elphaba's magic into the famous Scarecrow.</p>\n\n<p>Liir, son of Elphaba (though this was long uncertain), was raised among the Vinkans. His awkward attempts to fit into Arjiki society and his eventual romance with the Quadling woman Candle created another bridge between cultures.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Kiamo Ko's status depends on the campaign era. Is it still held by the Arjikis? Has it fallen into ruin? Do ghosts walk its halls?</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki Male Names:</strong> Fiyero, Manek, Irji, Nor (though Nor is female)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki Female Names:</strong> Sarima, Nor, Ama, Kiir</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arjiki Family Names:</strong> Tigelaar, Grassthorn, Plainwalker, Sunspear</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scrow Names:</strong> Harsher consonants\u2014Krek, Skarn, Drak, Grishna</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yunamata Names:</strong> Often blend Vinkan and Quadling elements\u2014Reedwalker, Marshwind</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Vinkan</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I say exactly what I mean; deception is dishonorable.</li>\n<li>I'm most comfortable outdoors under open sky.</li>\n<li>I solve conflicts through physical contests when possible.</li>\n<li>I'm intensely loyal to my tribe/clan but suspicious of outsiders.</li>\n<li>I find lowlander customs confusing and often ridiculous.</li>\n<li>I carry tokens from home and perform small daily rituals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Honor:</strong> A Vinkan's word is their bond; break it and you are nothing. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Freedom:</strong> No one has the right to tell me how to live. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Strength:</strong> The strong protect the weak; that is the natural order. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Tradition:</strong> Our ways have sustained us for generations; change is dangerous. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Independence:</strong> The Vinkus owes nothing to the Emerald City. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Might:</strong> Power determines who leads and who follows. (Evil)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My tribe raised me; I would die for any of them.</li>\n<li>I seek to restore honor to my family name after a disgrace.</li>\n<li>Kiamo Ko holds secrets my bloodline needs to reclaim.</li>\n<li>I was raised by Elphaba's household; her memory shapes me.</li>\n<li>A rival tribe killed my [family member]; I seek justice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I respond to insults with violence, even when it's unwise.</li>\n<li>I'm arrogant about Vinkan superiority and dismissive of other cultures.</li>\n<li>I can't read or write, and I'm too proud to admit it bothers me.</li>\n<li>I hold grudges against rival tribes even when alliance is necessary.</li>\n<li>I'm haunted by the wars that came to the Vinkus because of the Witch.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Arjiki Vinkan</h3>\n<p>If your character is specifically Arjiki, replace <strong>Tribal Weapon Training</strong> with <strong>Arjiki Warrior Training:</strong> You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and one artisan's tools of your choice (often related to leather-working, bone-carving, or weapon-smithing).</p>\n\n<h3>Scrow Vinkan</h3>\n<p>If your character is Scrow, replace <strong>Grassland Hunter</strong> with <strong>Scrow Raider:</strong> You gain proficiency in Stealth and Intimidation. Additionally, when you move through grasslands, you can attempt to hide even when only lightly obscured by natural phenomena.</p>\n\n<h3>Yunamata Vinkan</h3>\n<p>If your character is Yunamata, replace <strong>Vinkus Resilience</strong> with <strong>Between Worlds:</strong> You gain proficiency in one skill from the Quadling racial traits and one from the Vinkan racial traits. You can also speak both Quadling and a Vinkan tribal language.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Vinkan characters bring themes of cultural identity, colonialism vs. independence, and the clash between tradition and change. Consider these hooks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The party must navigate complex tribal politics to gain passage or alliance.</li>\n<li>Kiamo Ko holds something the party needs\u2014but at what cost?</li>\n<li>A Vinkan character faces a choice between lowlander alliance and tribal loyalty.</li>\n<li>The ghosts of the dragon wars resurface literally or metaphorically.</li>\n<li>Inter-tribal conflict threatens to explode into war; the party can mediate or take advantage.</li>\n<li>Elphaba's legacy in the Vinkus creates complications (sympathizers, enemies, cults).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not all Vinkans are noble savages or backwards warriors. Show the sophistication of their culture, the wisdom in their traditions, and the complexity of their political structures. Also show how colonialism and war have damaged them.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">The Vinkus (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/kiamo-ko', 'Kiamo Ko'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/fiyero-tigelaar', 'Fiyero Tigelaar'); return false;\">Fiyero Tigelaar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/sarima', 'Sarima'); return false;\">Sarima</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/arjiki-royal', 'Arjiki Royal'); return false;\">Arjiki Royal Connection (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/vinkus-exile', 'Vinkus Exile'); return false;\">Vinkus Tribal Exile (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/kiamo-ko-retainer', 'Kiamo Ko Retainer'); return false;\">Kiamo Ko Retainer (Background)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Some of us have worn them so long we've forgotten what we're not supposed to see.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>To be born in the Emerald City is to be born at the center of power\u2014and at the heart of corruption. The gleaming capital of Oz, where green dominates every surface (or appears to, through mandatory spectacles), is home to a complex urban society ranging from palace courtiers to slum-dwellers. Emerald City natives navigate a world of political intrigue, social stratification, and pervasive surveillance where every conversation might be reported and every friendship might be performative.</p>\n\n<p>The City's magic is subtle but pervasive. The green illusion created by the spectacles affects perception in ways both obvious and hidden. Those born there often develop an instinct for reading between lines, detecting lies, and presenting carefully curated versions of themselves. They are cosmopolitan, educated, and deeply complicit in the machinery of empire\u2014whether they acknowledge it or not.</p>\n\n<p>Emerald City society is rigidly stratified. Palace-adjacent families enjoy wealth, influence, and access. Merchants occupy a prosperous but precarious middle ground. Slum-born citizens struggle in the outer rings, where the green gleam fades and the reality of poverty shows through the cracks.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Charisma score increases by 1, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Emerald City natives mature at the same rate as other humans and live into their 80s or 90s, with palace families sometimes living longer due to access to magical healthcare.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Emerald City natives range from 5 to 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one of your choice (reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of the City)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>City Wisdom</h3>\n<p>You've learned to navigate complex social and political situations. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, Persuasion, or Investigation. Additionally, you can read, write, and speak one additional language of your choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Green-Blind (or Green-Sighted)</h3>\n<p>Choose one of the following traits:</p>\n<p><strong>Green-Blind:</strong> You've worn the spectacles your whole life and see the City as it's meant to be seen. You have advantage on saving throws against illusions but disadvantage on Investigation checks to see through the City's specific deceptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Green-Sighted:</strong> You've learned to see past the illusion. You have advantage on Investigation checks to detect the City's deceptions and can sometimes glimpse the truth, but you suffer from mild paranoia\u2014disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened in urban environments.</p>\n\n<h3>Urban Navigator</h3>\n<p>You know the rhythms of city life. You always know the quickest route through urban terrain, can blend into crowds with ease (advantage on Stealth checks in cities), and can usually find a contact who can provide information or services (at the DM's discretion).</p>\n\n<h2>Culture</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Palace-Adjacent:</strong> These families have wealth, titles, and power. They attend palace functions, influence policy, and marry strategically. They speak in coded language, dress in the latest fashions, and navigate intrigue like breathing. Many genuinely believe in the system; others are trapped by privilege they can't imagine abandoning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Merchant Class:</strong> The City's economic engine, these families run shops, trade networks, and craft guilds. They're shrewd, pragmatic, and often more aware of the City's darker realities than the palace crowd. Some collaborate with underground movements, others profit from exploitation. They walk a careful line.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slum-Born:</strong> In the outer rings, the green fades and harsh reality shows through. Poverty, crime, and desperation dominate. Many slum-dwellers are refugees from other provinces, former Animals, or descendants of those displaced by imperial projects. They survive through solidarity, street smarts, and sometimes crime. The resistance draws heavily from these communities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Green Illusion</h2>\n\n<p>Mandatory green-tinted spectacles create a collective hallucination\u2014or do they? Some say the City is genuinely green. Others claim it's all grey stone and deception. The truth may lie somewhere in between. The spectacles definitely affect perception, creating a shared reality that reinforces conformity and makes questioning dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Removing the spectacles in public is illegal and socially transgressive. Those who do often see things others miss\u2014but are branded as deviants, troublemakers, or worse.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Palace-Adjacent Names:</strong> Elegant, often with historical or literary references\u2014Alabaster, Chrysophrase, Malachite, Verdancy</p>\n\n<p><strong>Merchant Names:</strong> Practical but aspirational\u2014Sterling, Merit, Prosper, Grace</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slum Names:</strong> Often nicknames or references to circumstances\u2014Lucky, Rat, Copper, Ash, Hope</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Names:</strong> Palace families have long, prestigious names (Thropp, Chuffrey, Margreave). Merchant families have trade names (Goldsmith, Weaver). Slum families often lack formal surnames or adopt found names.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying an Emerald City Native</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I instinctively assess everyone I meet for their social status and connections.</li>\n<li>I keep my real opinions hidden behind pleasantries and ambiguity.</li>\n<li>I'm uncomfortable in natural settings; cities feel safe.</li>\n<li>I collect information compulsively\u2014you never know what might be useful.</li>\n<li>I maintain multiple social personas depending on the situation.</li>\n<li>I notice details others miss, especially inconsistencies and lies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Order:</strong> The system works because everyone knows their place. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Truth:</strong> The lies must end, even if it costs everything. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> I'll play whatever role keeps me alive and comfortable. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Ambition:</strong> I'll climb to the top no matter who I step on. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Revolution:</strong> Burn the palace and build something new. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Elegance:</strong> Beauty, wit, and style matter more than anything. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My family's reputation is everything; I'll protect it at any cost.</li>\n<li>I know a secret that could topple the government\u2014and it terrifies me.</li>\n<li>Someone I love is in the resistance; I pretend not to know.</li>\n<li>The slums raised me; I owe everything to that community.</li>\n<li>I witnessed something in the palace I can never unsee or speak of.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm so used to lying that I sometimes forget what's true.</li>\n<li>I'm addicted to luxury and can't bear discomfort.</li>\n<li>I sell information to the highest bidder without considering consequences.</li>\n<li>I'm paralyzed by fear of losing my social position.</li>\n<li>I've internalized the City's prejudices and look down on \"provincials.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Palace-Born</h3>\n<p>Replace <strong>Urban Navigator</strong> with <strong>Noble Bearing:</strong> You gain proficiency in Performance or Persuasion (choose one). Additionally, you can leverage your family name for advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with officials or nobility, but you also attract more scrutiny.</p>\n\n<h3>Southstairs Survivor</h3>\n<p>Some are born in the City's secret prison beneath the palace. Replace <strong>Green-Blind/Green-Sighted</strong> with <strong>Darkness Born:</strong> You have darkvision out to 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against fear, and proficiency in Stealth\u2014but you have disadvantage on Charisma checks with anyone who learns about your origin.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Emerald City natives work well as faces, spies, or conflicted insiders. Plot hooks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A character must choose between family and conscience.</li>\n<li>Information the character learned in the City becomes crucial.</li>\n<li>The character is recognized by someone from their past (positive or negative).</li>\n<li>The character's family is implicated in crimes against Animals or Quadlings.</li>\n<li>The green spectacles malfunction, revealing uncomfortable truths.</li>\n<li>A character must navigate palace politics or slum underworld contacts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City (Region)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/southstairs', 'Southstairs'); return false;\">Southstairs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/political-navigation', 'Political Navigation'); return false;\">Political Navigation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/green-sight', 'Green Sight'); return false;\">Green Sight</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/palace-servant', 'Palace Servant'); return false;\">Palace Servant (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/emerald-city-urchin', 'Emerald City Urchin'); return false;\">Emerald City Urchin (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/common/evergreen-spectacles', 'Evergreen Spectacles'); return false;\">Evergreen Spectacles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/true-sight-spectacles', 'True Sight Spectacles'); return false;\">True-Sight Spectacles</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I've seen things beyond their Desert that would shatter their small certainties.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Deadly Desert surrounds Oz on all sides, turning living flesh to sand and making passage nearly impossible. Yet some have crossed it\u2014the Wizard in his balloon, Dorothy in her whirlwind-carried house, and others through means mysterious or magical. Those who come from beyond are Outlanders, and they bring with them perspectives, technologies, and ideas utterly foreign to Oz.</p>\n\n<p>Outlanders are rare, strange, and often regarded with suspicion. They don't fit into Oz's rigid social categories. Their accents are different, their customs peculiar, their assumptions about how the world works fundamentally alien. Some adapt and assimilate; others remain forever apart. All carry the weight of displacement\u2014they can never truly go home, and they can never fully belong.</p>\n\n<p>The known lands beyond the Desert include Ev (with its Nome King and mechanical underground), Ix (a land of shamanic traditions and spirit worship), Quox (associated with dragons and fire), and the mysterious place called Kansas, from which both the Wizard and Dorothy originated. Each land has its own cultures, magic systems, and relationships to Oz.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another increases by 1, reflecting the diverse origins of Outlanders.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by origin, but generally similar to other humans (maturity around 18, lifespan 70-90 years).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium.

You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to spot contradictions, illusions, or cultural assumptions that don't make logical sense. Additionally, you're immune to being charmed by effects that rely on shared cultural context or patriotic sentiment specific to Oz.</p>\n\n<h3>Adaptable Survivor</h3>\n<p>Crossing the Deadly Desert or surviving displacement has made you resourceful. You gain proficiency in two of the following skills: Insight, Investigation, Perception, Survival. Additionally, when you finish a long rest, you can replace one of your skill proficiencies with another from this list, representing your ability to quickly adapt to new situations.</p>\n\n<h3>Foreign Knowledge</h3>\n<p>You possess knowledge from beyond Oz. Choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technological Understanding:</strong> You gain proficiency with tinker's tools and advantage on Intelligence checks to understand or repair mechanical devices (especially useful for Tiktoks).</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative Magic:</strong> You know one cantrip from any spell list, representing a different magical tradition. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (your choice).</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Wealth:</strong> You start with twice the normal starting gold and have contacts in your homeland who can occasionally send resources (DM's discretion).</li>\n<li><strong>Spirit Sight:</strong> You can cast <em>detect magic</em> once per long rest without expending a spell slot, as you learned spirit-sensing techniques in your homeland.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Culture by Origin</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Evian:</strong> From the underground kingdom ruled by the Nome King, Evians are familiar with subterranean life, mechanical constructs, and rigid hierarchies. They tend toward pragmatism and have complicated relationships with surface life. Many have darker skin tones and are shorter than average Ozians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ixian:</strong> From a land of shamans and spirit worship, Ixians bring mystical knowledge foreign to Oz's magic traditions. They often seem otherworldly to Ozians, with different concepts of time, souls, and reality. They tend toward tall, slender builds and often have intricate tattoos representing spiritual journeys.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quoxian:</strong> From a volcanic land associated with dragons, Quoxians are comfortable with heat, fire, and danger. They're often seen as reckless or passionate by Ozian standards. Many have tanned or reddish-brown skin and dramatic features.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kansan (or Unknown):</strong> From a place called Kansas or other unknown lands beyond, these Outlanders are perhaps the strangest. They come from places without magic, without talking Animals, without color-coded provinces. Everything about Oz astonishes them, and their questions reveal uncomfortable truths. They tend to be from rural, agricultural backgrounds and are often bewildered by Oz's political complexities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Question of Return</h2>\n\n<p>Most Outlanders cannot return home. The Wizard failed to go back in his balloon. Dorothy left but kept returning, suggesting the Deadly Desert doesn't block her specifically\u2014or that she has access to magic (the Silver Shoes, the Ruby Slippers) that transcends normal rules. For most Outlanders, Oz is exile, permanent and absolute. This colors everything.</p>\n\n<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>\n\n<p>Names vary dramatically by origin:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Evian Names:</strong> Often earthy or gem-related\u2014Granite, Copper, Jade, Obsidian, Ruggedo</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ixian Names:</strong> Flowing and mystical\u2014Seraphina, Zephyr, Luminara, Cascade</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quoxian Names:</strong> Sharp and dramatic\u2014Blaze, Scorch, Cinder, Pyra, Ignatius</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kansan Names:</strong> Simple and familiar (to our world)\u2014Dorothy, Oscar (the Wizard), Henry, Em, regular American names</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying an Outlander</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I ask \"why\" about everything, much to locals' annoyance.</li>\n<li>I compare everything to \"how we did it back home.\"</li>\n<li>I'm fascinated by aspects of Oz that natives find mundane.</li>\n<li>I feel like I'm always performing, never quite belonging.</li>\n<li>I hoard reminders of home\u2014objects, stories, recipes.</li>\n<li>I unconsciously use phrases or gestures from my homeland that confuse Ozians.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Truth:</strong> Outsiders see clearly; I'll speak truths locals can't. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> I'll bring the best of both worlds together. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Superiority:</strong> My homeland's ways are obviously better. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> I'll use my unique knowledge for personal gain. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Belonging:</strong> I'll do whatever it takes to fit in here. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Return:</strong> I exist only to find a way home. (Any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I left family/friends behind; I think of them constantly.</li>\n<li>Someone in Oz helped me when I first arrived; I owe them everything.</li>\n<li>I'm the last keeper of knowledge from my homeland; if I die, it dies.</li>\n<li>I was sent here on purpose with a specific mission.</li>\n<li>I found love in Oz; now I'm torn between two worlds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm insufferably condescending about how \"primitive\" Oz is.</li>\n<li>I'm paralyzed by homesickness and depression.</li>\n<li>I trust no one because I've been othered and betrayed.</li>\n<li>I appropriate Ozian culture clumsily, causing offense.</li>\n<li>I'm so desperate to belong that I'll compromise any principle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Wizard's Kin (Kansan)</h3>\n<p>If you're from Kansas or a similar non-magical world, replace <strong>Foreign Knowledge</strong> with <strong>Technological Prodigy:</strong> You gain proficiency in two types of artisan's tools and advantage on Intelligence checks related to mechanical devices, chemistry, or \"mundane\" sciences unknown in Oz.</p>\n\n<h3>Nome-Touched (Evian)</h3>\n<p>If you're from Ev or have connections to the underground kingdom, replace <strong>Adaptable Survivor</strong> with <strong>Subterranean Affinity:</strong> You have darkvision out to 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against being frightened while underground, and you can communicate simple ideas with constructs (like Tiktoks) even if they can't normally speak.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Outlander characters are fish-out-of-water protagonists who can ask questions the DM wants explored. They're great for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlighting the strangeness of Ozian society to the audience.</li>\n<li>Bringing outside knowledge that solves problems in unexpected ways.</li>\n<li>Creating connections to lands beyond for expansion possibilities.</li>\n<li>Exploring themes of immigration, displacement, and belonging.</li>\n<li>Being the only one who questions \"that's just how things are.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be thoughtful about the \"chosen one from outside\" trope. Dorothy is special partly because she's an outsider, but that can become problematic if it implies Ozians can't solve their own problems.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/deadly-desert', 'The Deadly Desert'); return false;\">The Deadly Desert</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">The Wizard of Oz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dorothy-gale', 'Dorothy Gale'); return false;\">Dorothy Gale</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/ev', 'Ev'); return false;\">Ev (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/ix', 'Ix'); return false;\">Ix (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/quox', 'Quox'); return false;\">Quox (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/foreign-lands/kansas', 'Kansas'); return false;\">Kansas (Foreign Land)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/foreign-diplomat', 'Foreign Diplomat'); return false;\">Foreign Diplomat (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/wizards-balloon', 'The Wizard's Balloon'); return false;\">The Wizard's Balloon</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<h1>Animals (Sentient)</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"We are Animals, not animals. The difference is a soul, a voice, and the capacity to be murdered rather than merely slaughtered.\"</em> \u2014 Dr. Dillamond</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>In Oz, some creatures are Animals (capital-A) \u2014 fully sentient, speaking beings with souls, cultures, and rights. Others are animals (lowercase-a) \u2014 non-sentient beasts. The line between them is one of the most contested and dangerous questions in Ozian society. Animals have been systematically persecuted, stripped of rights, and in many cases forcibly <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> \u2014 their ability to speak magically removed, reducing them to the status of mere animals.</p>\n\n<p>The persecution of Animals is central to the political horror of Oz. It began subtly under <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">the Wizard's</a> regime and intensified over time. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a>, once home to Animal professors like the goat <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a>, banned Animal faculty. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> was infiltrated and destroyed. Animals were required to register with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">the Gale Force</a>, then stripped of citizenship, then hunted.</p>\n\n<p>Playing an Animal character means playing someone whose personhood is constantly questioned, whose rights can be revoked at any moment, and who must navigate a society built on their oppression. It also means playing a character with rich cultural traditions, deep community bonds, and the strength that comes from surviving systematic dehumanization.</p>\n\n<h2>The Animal Question</h2>\n\n<p>What makes an Animal different from an animal? Ozians have debated this for generations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Soul Theory:</strong> Animals have souls granted by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> or awakened through unknown means. This is the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a> view.</li>\n<li><strong>The Denial:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionist</a> orthodoxy claims Animals don't have souls and thus aren't truly people. This justifies persecution.</li>\n<li><strong>The Reform Position:</strong> Some Unionists argue Animals do have souls and deserve rights, creating internal church conflict.</li>\n<li><strong>The Scientific Mystery:</strong> Scholars like Dr. Dillamond sought biological explanations but were silenced before finding answers.</li>\n<li><strong>The Spontaneous Awakening:</strong> Some believe animals can spontaneously become Animals under certain conditions, though this is unproven.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Playing an Animal: General Considerations</h2>\n\n<p>All Animal characters share certain realities regardless of species:</p>\n\n<h3>Social Persecution</h3>\n<p>You face discrimination ranging from social slights to active violence. In some eras and regions, being an Animal is a death sentence. You must choose how your character responds: resistance, hiding, collaboration, or simple survival.</p>\n\n<h3>Registration and Documentation</h3>\n<p>In many periods, Animals must register with authorities, wear identifying markers, or carry papers. Failure to do so can result in arrest, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silencing</a>, or worse. Some Animals refuse on principle; others comply to survive; still others use forged papers.</p>\n\n<h3>The Question of Eating Meat</h3>\n<p>If lions and bears are people, what do they eat? This creates moral complexity. Some Animals are vegetarian by choice or necessity. Others eat animals (lowercase) and live with the guilt or justify it as natural. Some radical Animals refuse to eat any creature, sentient or not. This often creates tension between predator and prey Animals.</p>\n\n<h3>Animal Culture vs. Animal Nature</h3>\n<p>Animal characters balance cultural identity (Lion society, Bear scholarship traditions, etc.) with their physical nature (carnivore instincts, flight capabilities, etc.). This tension between civilization and nature is ever-present.</p>\n\n<h3>Community and Solidarity</h3>\n<p>Animals often band together across species lines. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> united different bird species. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> includes mammals, birds, and others. Shared oppression creates bonds that transcend natural divisions.</p>\n\n<h2>Mechanical Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Animal player characters use modified racial traits that account for both their animal nature and their sentient status:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Size Variation:</strong> Animals range from Small (many birds, young bears) to Large (elephants, adult bears). Large PCs should discuss with DM.</li>\n<li><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Many Animals have claws, beaks, or other natural weapons, but using them can be seen as \"savage.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Movement Types:</strong> Flying Animals have special movement rules. Swimming Animals have aquatic advantages.</li>\n<li><strong>Speech and Silencing:</strong> The constant threat of being <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> (forcibly stripped of speech) hangs over all Animals.</li>\n<li><strong>Tools and Equipment:</strong> Animals may struggle with equipment designed for human hands, requiring adaptive tools or magic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Types of Animals</h2>\n\n<p>The following pages detail specific Animal types:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals</a> \u2014 Bears, Lions, Wolves, Tigers, Elephants, and more</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Birds</a> \u2014 Eagles, Crows, Owls, Songbirds, and the Conference tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">Reptiles & Amphibians</a> \u2014 The less common Animal types</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/fish-question', 'Fish Question'); return false;\">The Question of Fish</a> \u2014 Are fish Animals? The debate continues</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/hybrid-uncertain', 'Hybrid Uncertain'); return false;\">Hybrid & Uncertain Status</a> \u2014 Kalidahs, magical creations, and edge cases</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Historical Context</h2>\n\n<h3>The Golden Age (Pre-Wizard)</h3>\n<p>Before <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">the Wizard</a>, Animals lived relatively freely. They held positions of authority, taught at universities, and participated fully in society. This wasn't utopia \u2014 prejudice existed \u2014 but Animals had legal rights and social standing.</p>\n\n<h3>The Wizard's Suppression</h3>\n<p>The Wizard began subtle campaigns against Animals: propaganda suggesting they were dangerous, policies limiting their roles, encouragement of discrimination. By the end of his reign, Animals were being actively hunted. Dr. Dillamond's murder at Shiz marked a turning point.</p>\n\n<h3>The Conference of the Birds</h3>\n<p>A political organization of Animal birds that advocated for Animal rights and coordinated resistance. It was infiltrated by government agents and destroyed, with many members killed or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a>. Its destruction scattered the Animal resistance and created lasting trauma.</p>\n\n<h3>Current Era (Variable by Campaign)</h3>\n<p>Depending on when your campaign is set, Animals may be in hiding, fighting active resistance, slowly regaining rights, or still facing genocide. The GM determines the current state of Animal persecution.</p>\n\n<h2>Passing as animal</h2>\n\n<p>Some Animals choose to \"pass\" as non-sentient animals to avoid persecution. They don't speak in public, pretend to be pets or working animals, and hide their intelligence. This is survival but comes at a terrible psychological cost. See the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a> for mechanics.</p>\n\n<h2>The Underground Railroad</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a> is a network dedicated to smuggling Animals to safety, usually to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling Country</a> or the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkus</a> where central authority is weaker. It's dangerous, secretive, and essential. Many Animal PCs have connections to it.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Guidance</h2>\n\n<p>Animal persecution is an allegory for real-world oppression. Handle it with care:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Session Zero:</strong> Discuss comfort levels with themes of genocide, dehumanization, and systematic oppression.</li>\n<li><strong>Lines and Veils:</strong> Establish what can be depicted on-screen vs. implied off-screen.</li>\n<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Animal PCs should have meaningful choices, not just suffer helplessly.</li>\n<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Not all humans are oppressors; not all Animals are noble. Show the full range.</li>\n<li><strong>Hope:</strong> Even in darkness, resistance, community, and small victories matter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Birds (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">The Conference of the Birds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced (Condition)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/animal-etiquette', 'Animal Etiquette'); return false;\">Animal Etiquette (Special Skill)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/former-animal', 'Former Animal'); return false;\">Former Animal (Background)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

I am Brrr, and I have a soul.\"</em> \u2014 The Cowardly Lion</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Mammalian Animals are perhaps the most visible and most persecuted in Oz. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr the Lion</a>, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Princess Nastoya the Elephant</a>, and countless unnamed Bears, Wolves, Tigers, and others have shaped Ozian history. They are scholars, warriors, leaders, and victims. Their size, strength, and predatory nature make them particularly threatening to human supremacists, leading to targeted violence and suppression.</p>\n\n<p>Each mammalian species has developed distinct cultures and traditions. Bears are known for scholarship and record-keeping. Lions navigate complex social hierarchies and the weight of being symbols (the \"cowardly lion\" legend haunts <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr</a> throughout his life). Elephants maintain matriarchal societies and long memories. Wolves form tight pack structures that emphasize loyalty. Each species brings unique perspectives and challenges.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits (Mammals - General)</h2>\n\n<p>All mammalian Animals share certain baseline traits, modified by specific species:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species (see below)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Mammalian Animals live roughly as long as their animal counterparts would naturally\u2014Bears and Elephants may reach 50-60 years, Lions and Wolves 20-30, smaller mammals less. However, sentience seems to extend natural lifespans somewhat.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species and age. Most are Medium, but some (like Elephants or adult Bears) are Large. Discuss Large PCs with your DM.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species, typically 30-40 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one species language (Leonine, Ursine, Lupine, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Animal Senses</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell or hearing. Your keen senses mark you as an Animal, making it harder to pass as human.</p>\n\n<h3>Natural Weapons</h3>\n<p>You have claws, fangs, or other natural weapons. You can make unarmed strikes dealing 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing or piercing damage (your choice). However, using your natural weapons in \"civilized\" settings marks you as savage and may trigger hostile reactions. Many Animals refuse to use them except in dire circumstances.</p>\n\n<h3>Thick Hide or Fur</h3>\n<p>When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Target of Persecution</h3>\n<p>You are subject to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">Gale Force</a> registration laws, social discrimination, and potential violence. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when dealing with openly anti-Animal NPCs. However, you have advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> or sympathetic communities.</p>\n\n<h2>Species Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Bear (Ursine)</h3>\n\n<p>Bears are known for their scholarly traditions. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a> once had multiple Bear professors before the purges. Bears value knowledge, record-keeping, and thoughtful analysis. They're often larger and slower than other Animals but possess great strength and wisdom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (young) or Large (adult, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (your size and build make you less agile)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scholar's Tradition:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check related to recalling lore or information you've read, you can add double your proficiency bonus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powerful Build:</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hibernation Knowledge:</strong> You require only 4 hours of sleep during a long rest instead of 6 (though you still need 8 hours for a full rest). During winter months, you feel a strong urge to sleep more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Bear characters often struggle between their intellectual pursuits and society's view of them as dangerous beasts. Many were or knew professors who were purged from <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz</a>. The loss of scholarly community weighs heavily.</p>\n\n<h3>Lion (Leonine)</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr</a>, the famous \"Cowardly\" Lion, has shaped how Ozians view all Lions\u2014often unfairly. Lions navigate complex social hierarchies, both within their own prides and in broader Ozian society. They're seen as symbols: courage, nobility, ferocity, or (thanks to Brrr's legend) cowardice. This symbolic weight is a burden.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (females, young males) or Large (adult males, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 35 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regal Presence:</strong> Despite persecution, Lions carry themselves with dignity. You have proficiency in the Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice). Additionally, when you make a Charisma check to assert authority or demand respect, you can add your Strength modifier instead of Charisma (minimum +0).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pride Tactics:</strong> When an ally within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the attacker. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you have advantage on your next attack roll against them before the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hunter's Instinct:</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to stalk prey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Lion characters often grapple with the Brrr legend and expectations of nobility or courage. Some embrace the reputation; others are crushed by it. See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr's story</a> for the complexity of Lion identity in Oz.</p>\n\n<h3>Wolf (Lupine)</h3>\n\n<p>Wolves emphasize pack, loyalty, and collective survival. They work together instinctively, communicate through body language and subtle signals, and prioritize the group over the individual. In the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>, Wolves often serve as coordinators and tacticians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pack Tactics:</strong> You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. This represents your instinctive coordination with allies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keen Tracker:</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures and can track at a fast pace without penalty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Howl of the Pack:</strong> As an action, you can howl to signal allies within 1 mile. Allies who hear it know your general direction and emotional state. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. (Note: Howling may attract unwanted attention in hostile territory.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Wolf characters struggle when separated from pack/community. They thrive in groups and suffer alone. Many feel torn between Animal pack bonds and the diverse alliances of the resistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Tiger (Feline)</h3>\n\n<p>Tigers are solitary, fierce, and rare. Ivory Tigers, mentioned in the novels, are particularly exotic and endangered. Tigers are often stereotyped as dangerous and unpredictable, making them prime targets for <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silencing</a> or elimination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium or Large (DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 35 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solitary Hunter:</strong> You have advantage on attack rolls when you're the only ally within 30 feet of the target. You're most effective when working alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ambush Predator:</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in natural terrain (forests, grasslands, jungles). Additionally, during the first round of combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that haven't taken a turn yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pounce:</strong> If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you can make one additional claw attack against it as a bonus action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Tiger characters are often loners by nature but may join groups out of necessity. They face intense prejudice and are frequently hunted. Ivory Tigers may be nearly extinct, making survivors precious and endangered.</p>\n\n<h3>Elephant (Proboscidean)</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Princess Nastoya</a>, matriarch of her people, led the Elephants through exile and trauma. Elephants maintain long memories, matriarchal traditions, and deep wisdom. They're among the largest Animals, making them impossible to ignore and easy to target.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Large (Elephants cannot be Medium; discuss with your DM about playing a Large PC)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Matriarch's Memory:</strong> Elephants never forget. You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information you've personally encountered. Additionally, you can perfectly recall any conversation or event you experienced within the past year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trunk Dexterity:</strong> Your trunk can manipulate objects, carry up to 30 pounds, and function as a natural \"hand\" for tasks. You can use your trunk to grapple creatures or manipulate objects while your feet remain planted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Powerful Build:</strong> You count as Huge when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thick Hide:</strong> Your AC calculation from natural armor becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier (instead of 12).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charge:</strong> If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a gore or slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Elephant characters carry the weight of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Nastoya's</a> legacy and their people's persecution. They remember every injustice, every lost family member, every broken promise. This can be both strength and burden.</p>\n\n<h3>Badger, Ape, and Other Mammals</h3>\n\n<p>Other mammalian species exist as Animals: Badgers (tenacious diggers), Apes (tool-users and climbers), Foxes (cunning survivors), and more. Work with your DM to create appropriate traits based on the species' natural abilities and cultural role in Oz.</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Guidelines:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>+2 to one ability, +1 to another based on species strengths</li>\n<li>One or two species-specific abilities (burrowing, climbing, etc.)</li>\n<li>Natural weapons appropriate to the species</li>\n<li>Cultural background related to their role in Animal society</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Burden of Being a Predator</h2>\n\n<p>Carnivorous Animals face an additional moral weight: if they eat meat, they may be eating animals (lowercase-a) that could potentially become Animals. Or worse, in dark times, the meat industry may be secretly processing <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> Animals. Many predatory Animals become vegetarian, suffering malnutrition rather than risk cannibalism. Others eat and don't think too hard about it. Some justify it philosophically. This creates internal conflict and external judgment.</p>\n\n<h2>Animal Society and Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Before the persecution, Animals had rich cultural traditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bears</strong> maintained vast libraries and taught at universities</li>\n<li><strong>Lions</strong> held courts and settled disputes through formal combat or debate</li>\n<li><strong>Wolves</strong> organized pack councils with democratic elements</li>\n<li><strong>Elephants</strong> passed down oral histories spanning generations</li>\n<li><strong>Tigers</strong> practiced solitary contemplation and hunting rituals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Much of this has been lost or driven underground. Animals fighting to preserve these traditions risk everything.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Mammalian Animal PCs bring physical power and cultural weight to the party. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Size Challenges:</strong> Large Animals may struggle with dungeon doors, city streets, or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/witch-broom', 'Witch's Broom'); return false;\">Witch's Brooms</a></li>\n<li><strong>Prejudice:</strong> Vary how NPCs react\u2014some hostile, some sympathetic, most fearful</li>\n<li><strong>Practical Problems:</strong> How do Lions open doors? How do Elephants buy clothes? These details matter</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Loss:</strong> NPCs who remember \"the before times\" can provide poignant moments</li>\n<li><strong>Hope and Resistance:</strong> Even in darkness, Animal communities support each other</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Birds (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/brrr', 'Brrr'); return false;\">Brrr (The Cowardly Lion)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-nastoya', 'Princess Nastoya'); return false;\">Princess Nastoya</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced (Condition)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/conference-veteran', 'Conference Veteran'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds Veteran (Background)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Now even the sky isn't safe.\"</em> \u2014 A surviving Conference member</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Bird Animals occupy a unique position in Oz: they can fly, making them both valuable messengers and difficult to capture. Yet this mobility also made them prime targets when <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">the Gale Force</a> decided to eliminate organized Animal resistance. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> was the most organized Animal political movement in history\u2014and its destruction remains one of the great traumas of Animal society.</p>\n\n<p>Birds range from tiny songbirds to massive eagles. Some, like Crows, have developed extensive intelligence networks. Others, like Owls, are associated with wisdom, death omens, or both. Eagles are warriors and leaders. Each species brings different capabilities and cultural traditions, but all share the gift and curse of flight.</p>\n\n<p>Before the persecution, Birds served as messengers, scouts, scholars, and diplomats. Now, many hide their sentience, pretending to be mere birds. Others joined the resistance, using their aerial advantage for reconnaissance and communication. Still others were captured, caged, and <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a>\u2014their wings clipped, their voices stolen.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits (Birds - General)</h2>\n\n<p>All Bird Animals share certain baseline traits, modified by specific species:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species (see below)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Bird Animals live roughly as long as their species naturally would, though sentience seems to extend lifespans. Crows and Ravens may reach 50+ years, songbirds 10-20, Eagles 30-40.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small (most songbirds, small crows) or Medium (eagles, large owls, ravens). Tiny birds are generally not playable without heavy modification.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>25-30 feet walking, 50-60 feet flying (varies by species)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and Avian (with species-specific dialects)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Flight</h3>\n<p>You have a flying speed listed in your species traits. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor, or if your wings are clipped or bound. If you're knocked prone, fall unconscious, or are otherwise incapacitated while flying, you fall unless you can hover. This ability makes you incredibly valuable\u2014and incredibly targeted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wing Clipping:</strong> In some eras and regions, authorities clip the wings of captured Bird Animals, permanently removing their ability to fly. This is considered a form of torture and mutilation. A clipped bird can sometimes regain flight through powerful healing magic, but the psychological trauma persists.</p>\n\n<h3>Keen Vision</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. You can see details at great distances that others miss.</p>\n\n<h3>Hollow Bones</h3>\n<p>Your bones are light but fragile. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid being grappled or restrained, but you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would knock you prone or push you.</p>\n\n<h3>Talons or Beak</h3>\n<p>You have a natural weapon\u2014talons or beak. You can make unarmed strikes dealing 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier piercing or slashing damage. Your hands (wing-claws) may be less dexterous than human hands, potentially affecting tool use (DM's discretion).</p>\n\n<h3>Conference Legacy</h3>\n<p>All Bird Animals carry the memory of the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a>, whether they personally remember it or not. You have advantage on Intelligence checks related to Animal history and political movements. Additionally, when you meet other Bird Animals, you can usually establish trust quickly through shared cultural references and grief.</p>\n\n<h2>Species Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Eagle (Aquiline)</h3>\n\n<p>Eagles are warriors, leaders, and symbols of freedom. They're large, powerful, and difficult to keep captive. Many Eagles fought openly during the Animal resistance and paid the price. Those who survive carry battle scars and deep conviction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet walking, 60 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Raptor's Dive:</strong> If you fly at least 30 feet toward a target and then hit it with a talon attack on the same turn, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage. If the target is a creature smaller than you, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Battlefield Commander:</strong> You have proficiency in Intimidation. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in combat, that ally gains advantage on their next attack roll and adds your Wisdom modifier to the damage if they hit (minimum +1).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Superior Vision:</strong> You can see clearly up to 1 mile away as if it were only 100 feet. Additionally, you ignore lightly obscured conditions when relying on sight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Eagle characters are often military veterans, resistance fighters, or community leaders. They struggle with survivor's guilt and the weight of failed uprisings. Many knew members of the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a> personally.</p>\n\n<h3>Crow/Raven (Corvid)</h3>\n\n<p>Crows and Ravens are intelligence-gatherers, tricksters, and survivors. They're brilliant, adaptable, and deeply social within their own kind. Corvid intelligence networks survived the purges better than most, making them invaluable to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small (Crow) or Medium (Raven, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 25 feet walking, 50 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mimicry:</strong> You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they're imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check. This ability has saved countless Corvids from capture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intelligence Network:</strong> You can communicate with other Corvids (sentient or not) within sight. Non-sentient crows will perform simple tasks for you (delivering small objects, watching locations, making noise as distraction). Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather information in cities or settlements where crows are present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clever Mind:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Investigation, or Sleight of Hand. Additionally, you can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for Sleight of Hand checks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Omen of Death:</strong> Whether true or superstition, Corvids are associated with death and ill omens. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against superstitious creatures, but disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with those same creatures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Corvid characters are often spies, information brokers, or messengers. They know everyone's secrets\u2014which makes them valuable and dangerous. Many operated in the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a> as intelligence coordinators.</p>\n\n<h3>Owl (Strigine)</h3>\n\n<p>Owls are associated with wisdom, night, and death. They're silent fliers, nocturnal hunters, and often scholars or mystics. Their connection to night and death gives them an air of the uncanny that makes other Ozians uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small (most owls) or Medium (great horned owl, eagle owl)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 25 feet walking, 50 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Silent Flight:</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while flying. Your wings make no sound, allowing you to approach or escape undetected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Darkvision:</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nocturnal:</strong> You're most active at night. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in darkness or dim light. However, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight in bright sunlight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scholar's Wisdom:</strong> You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Arcana, Insight, Medicine, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check to recall information or notice hidden details, you can reroll the die once and must use the new roll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Owl characters are often solitary scholars, mystics, or watchers. They see things others miss\u2014literally and metaphorically. Many feel disconnected from the broader Animal community due to their nocturnal nature and unsettling reputation.</p>\n\n<h3>Songbird (Passerine)</h3>\n\n<p>Songbirds\u2014thrushes, sparrows, finches, nightingales\u2014are small, vulnerable, and numerous. They were often dismissed as unimportant, which ironically helped some survive. Songbird messengers can fly unnoticed where larger birds would be shot. Their voices carry warnings, songs, and coded messages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 20 feet walking, 50 feet flying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Melodic Voice:</strong> You have proficiency in Performance. Additionally, you can use your song to communicate emotions and simple concepts to any creature within hearing range, regardless of language barriers. This isn't magical, but it's remarkably effective.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unassuming:</strong> Your small size and \"harmless\" appearance work to your advantage. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to appear innocent or non-threatening. Additionally, you're often underestimated\u2014use it wisely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Swift Flight:</strong> Your flying speed is not reduced when moving through tight spaces that would normally require squeezing (as long as they're large enough for your actual size).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fragile Frame:</strong> Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 per level (minimum 1 hit point per level). You're more vulnerable than larger Animals, but you compensate with speed and cunning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Songbird characters are survivors who've learned to use their perceived weakness as strength. They're messengers, spies, and the eyes of the resistance. Many carry messages for the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Underground Railroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Other Bird Species</h3>\n\n<p>Other bird species exist as Animals: Hawks, Falcons, Herons, Woodpeckers, and more. Work with your DM to create appropriate traits based on natural abilities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Conference of the Birds</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> was the pinnacle of Animal political organization. Founded in the early years of persecution, it united bird species in coordinated resistance and advocacy. The Conference held secret meetings, coordinated information networks, lobbied (unsuccessfully) for Animal rights, and planned collective action.</p>\n\n<p>It was infiltrated by government agents, betrayed by collaborators, and violently destroyed. Many Conference members were killed, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a>, or imprisoned in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/southstairs', 'Southstairs'); return false;\">Southstairs</a>. The destruction scattered bird Animals across Oz and created lasting trauma. Yet the memory persists, and some say the Conference never truly died\u2014it merely went deeper underground.</p>\n\n<p>Bird PCs often have personal or family connections to the Conference. Perhaps a grandparent was a member. Perhaps they survived the purge as a fledgling. The Conference is both inspiration and cautionary tale.</p>\n\n<h2>Flight and Freedom</h2>\n\n<p>Flight represents freedom\u2014which is why authorities target it. In some regions, flying Animals are shot on sight. In others, they must register their flight patterns with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">the Gale Force</a>. Some cities ban flying entirely within city limits. The sky should be freedom, but it's become another space of surveillance and danger.</p>\n\n<p>Many bird Animals choose to walk rather than fly in public, hiding their greatest gift to survive. This self-imposed limitation weighs heavily. Imagine having wings and being afraid to use them.</p>\n\n<h2>Messenger Traditions</h2>\n\n<p>Despite persecution, bird Animals continue serving as messengers\u2014it's both livelihood and calling. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Underground Railroad</a> relies heavily on bird messengers. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> uses them to coordinate across distances. Even <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese</a> nobles employ bird messengers (often treating them as mere animals, which is both offensive and occasionally useful cover).</p>\n\n<p>Messenger birds use coded messages, multiple routes, and careful timing. They know they're targets\u2014one well-placed arrow ends everything. Yet they fly anyway because communication is resistance.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Bird Animal PCs add mobility and vulnerability to the party:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flight is Powerful:</strong> Be prepared for creative aerial solutions to problems</li>\n<li><strong>Flight is Dangerous:</strong> Archers, weather, exhaustion, and wing damage are constant threats</li>\n<li><strong>Size Matters:</strong> Small birds face different challenges than Medium birds</li>\n<li><strong>Conference Survivors:</strong> NPCs who remember the Conference are either inspiring or broken</li>\n<li><strong>Messaging:</strong> Bird PCs may be asked to carry messages\u2014some safe, some deadly</li>\n<li><strong>The Temptation to Hide:</strong> It's easier to pretend to be a non-sentient bird; address this temptation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals (Animal Races)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">The Conference of the Birds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced (Condition)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/southstairs', 'Southstairs'); return false;\">Southstairs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/conference-veteran', 'Conference Veteran'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds Veteran (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/animal-passing', 'Animal Passing as animal'); return false;\">Animal Passing as animal (Background)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/messenger-bird-clockwork', 'Messenger Bird Clockwork'); return false;\">Messenger Bird (Clockwork)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

As if the temperature of our blood determines the warmth of our souls.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Reptilian and amphibian Animals are rare, poorly understood, and often feared. Unlike the mammal and bird Animals who have established cultures and histories, reptilian Animals exist in the margins\u2014mentioned in whispers, seen rarely, and subject to even more suspicion than their warm-blooded cousins. The question of whether <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> are Animals, beasts, or something else entirely further complicates matters.</p>\n\n<p>Snakes, lizards, frogs, toads, salamanders, and turtles may or may not be sentient. There are no confirmed Snake professors at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz</a>, no Frog delegates to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> (despite the name suggesting cross-species unity), and no well-known Turtle scholars. Yet occasional reports surface of speaking serpents in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling marshes</a>, wise turtles offering cryptic advice, or lizards serving as guides in the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkus</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The scarcity might be real\u2014perhaps few reptiles achieve sentience. Or it might be concealment\u2014reptiles are easier to mistake for non-sentient animals, making \"passing\" simpler and safer. Or perhaps cold-blooded Animals simply don't integrate into warm-blooded society, maintaining separate communities unknown to mammals and birds.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits (Reptile/Amphibian - General)</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the diversity and rarity of reptilian/amphibian Animals, these traits are more variable than other Animal types. Work with your DM to create a character appropriate to your specific species.</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Varies by species (see examples below)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Highly variable. Turtles may live 100+ years, frogs 10-20, snakes 20-30. Sentience seems to extend lifespans.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small (most frogs, small snakes, lizards) to Medium (large snakes, turtles, crocodilians)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>20-30 feet, with climb or swim speeds depending on species</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one language (Serpentine, Batrachian, etc. \u2014if a language even exists)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Cold-Blooded</h3>\n<p>You are ectothermic, relying on external heat sources. In cold environments (below 50\u00b0F), you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. In warm environments (above 70\u00b0F), you function normally or even gain advantage on certain checks (DM's discretion). You can enter a state of torpor during extreme cold, reducing your need for food but also rendering you vulnerable.</p>\n\n<h3>Natural Camouflage</h3>\n<p>Your scales or skin help you blend into natural environments. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in natural terrain matching your species' habitat (swamps for frogs, forests for snakes, etc.).</p>\n\n<h3>Limited Animal Culture</h3>\n<p>Unlike mammals and birds, you have little connection to broader Animal political movements. You weren't represented in the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference</a>, and the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> has few reptilian members. This isolation is both curse (no support network) and blessing (less targeted by persecution\u2014maybe). You feel like an outsider even among outsiders.</p>\n\n<h2>Species Examples</h2>\n\n<h3>Snake (Serpentine)</h3>\n\n<p>Snakes are feared, associated with evil and deception across many cultures\u2014including in Oz. A speaking snake triggers primal unease. Yet some snakes are wise, others merely trying to survive with a body plan poorly suited to tool use or social integration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small or Medium (large constrictors)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet, climb 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Serpentine Body:</strong> You have no limbs. You can manipulate objects using your mouth and coils but have disadvantage on Strength checks requiring fine manipulation. Many tools and weapons are unusable without adaptation. However, your flexible body allows you to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 6 inches in diameter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Venomous Bite (Optional):</strong> Some snakes have venom. If you choose this option, your bite attack (1d4 piercing damage) also forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 2d4 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> You have proficiency in Perception. Additionally, you can sense vibrations in the ground, giving you tremorsense out to 10 feet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Snake characters face extreme prejudice and practical challenges. How do you open doors? Write? Use tools? Some snakes use <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/animated-helper-construct', 'Animated Helper Construct'); return false;\">magical assistants</a> or partner with other Animals in symbiotic relationships.</p>\n\n<h3>Frog/Toad (Batrachian)</h3>\n\n<p>Frogs and toads inhabit marshes and wet environments, particularly in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling Country</a>. Some <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;\">Quadlings</a> claim to have learned <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon trance</a> techniques from frog spirits\u2014suggesting an ancient relationship.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 25 feet, swim 25 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amphibious:</strong> You can breathe both air and water, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jumper:</strong> Your jump distance is tripled. Additionally, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength when calculating jump distances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marsh Walker:</strong> You ignore difficult terrain in swamps, marshes, and wetlands. Additionally, you have advantage on saves against diseases common in wet environments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Poisonous Skin (Optional):</strong> Some frogs secrete toxins. Creatures that grapple you or hit you with unarmed strikes must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or take 1d4 poison damage and have disadvantage on their next attack roll.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Frog characters often have connections to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;\">Quadling</a> communities and <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon</a> spiritual traditions. They're often seen as mystical or uncanny.</p>\n\n<h3>Turtle/Tortoise (Chelonian)</h3>\n\n<p>Turtles are ancient, patient, and resilient. They carry their homes on their backs and measure time in decades. A turtle who claims to remember events from a century ago might be telling the truth\u2014or might be something stranger than a simple Animal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small or Medium</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 20 feet (slow but steady), swim 20 feet (aquatic turtles)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Armor:</strong> Your shell provides excellent protection. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 15 + your Dexterity modifier. You can't use a shield and still gain this benefit. This is significantly better protection than most Animals, but it comes with weight and inflexibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shell Defense:</strong> As an action, you can withdraw into your shell. While withdrawn, your AC increases by 2, you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws, you have resistance to all damage, but your speed is 0, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ancient Memory:</strong> You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall historical information or events that happened more than 20 years ago. Turtles remember.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Turtle characters are often mentors, historians, or wanderers who've outlived everyone they knew. They move through time differently than others.</p>\n\n<h3>Lizard (Lacertilian)</h3>\n\n<p>Lizards are quick, adaptable, and often overlooked. They exist in the cracks of society\u2014literally and figuratively. Some serve as spies or scouts for the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">resistance</a>; others simply try to survive unnoticed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Small or Medium (monitor lizards, iguanas)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet, climb 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check (as long as the surface could reasonably support your weight).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tail Escape:</strong> When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shed your tail and immediately move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Your tail regrows over the course of a week. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until your tail regrows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chameleon Skin (Optional):</strong> Some lizards can change color. As an action, you can shift your skin color to match your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for the next 10 minutes. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Lizard characters are often loners, scouts, or urban survivors who've learned to thrive in the margins.</p>\n\n<h2>The Dragon Question</h2>\n\n<p>Are <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> reptilian Animals? This is fiercely debated. Dragons are clearly sentient and speak multiple languages. They're reptilian in appearance. But they're also massive, magical, and possibly not natural creatures at all. Some scholars argue Dragons are Animals. Others say they're something older, stranger, or more dangerous. Most people just try to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> for more information on playing draconic characters.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Reptilian/amphibian Animals are rare and mysterious.

      "title": "The Question of Fish",
      "category": null,
      "content": "<h1>The Question of Fish</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"If fish have souls, then half of Oz is guilty of cannibalism. So we've decided they don't. Convenient, isn't it?\"</em> \u2014 A cynical Unionist theologian</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Do fish have souls? Are they Animals (capital-A) or merely animals? This question torments philosophers, theologians, and anyone who's ever eaten a meal in Oz. The answer determines whether fish markets are food vendors or sites of ongoing genocide. The question has never been definitively settled\u2014perhaps because settling it would be too disturbing.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike mammals, birds, and even reptiles, there are no confirmed cases of a fish speaking, attending university, or participating in Animal political movements. No fish joined the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/conference-of-birds', 'The Conference of the Birds'); return false;\">Conference of the Birds</a> (though the name might suggest otherwise). No fish professor taught at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz</a>. No fish member of the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> has ever been documented.</p>\n\n<p>Yet absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Fish live in an environment inaccessible to most Ozians. How would a speaking fish even communicate with air-breathers? If fish have cultures, societies, and thoughts, they exist in a realm humans and most Animals can't easily access. The silence might be separation, not absence of sentience.</p>\n\n<h2>The Theological Debate</h2>\n\n<h3>The Unionist Position</h3>\n<p>Orthodox <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a> holds that fish do not have souls. This is doctrinally necessary\u2014if fish have souls, then eating fish is murder, and Ozian society would collapse. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'The Unnamed God'); return false;\">Unnamed God</a> supposedly created fish as food for beings with souls. This reasoning sounds suspiciously similar to the arguments used to justify Animal persecution, which reformist Unionists quietly note.</p>\n\n<h3>The Lurlinite Position</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinites</a> are divided. Some argue <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> granted souls to all creatures. Others suggest fish are part of the natural world, blessed by Lurline but not sentient in the same way. Still others admit they don't know and practice vegetarianism to be safe.</p>\n\n<h3>The Animal Perspective</h3>\n<p>Many Animals refuse to eat fish specifically because of this uncertainty. If fish might be people, eating them risks committing the same crime being perpetrated against Animals themselves. This moral caution creates solidarity across uncertain boundaries.</p>\n\n<h3>The Coastal Question</h3>\n<p>In coastal Animal communities\u2014particularly in regions bordering the great lakes or the ocean beyond the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/deadly-desert', 'The Deadly Desert'); return false;\">Deadly Desert</a>\u2014some claim to have communicated with fish Animals. These reports are dismissed by inland authorities but taken seriously by those who live near water. A few <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">bird Animals</a>, particularly diving species, insist fish have spoken to them beneath the waves.</p>\n\n<h2>If Fish Are Animals: Playing a Fish Character</h2>\n\n<p>Your GM may allow fish Animal characters in campaigns focused on aquatic adventures, or to explore the question of sentience and recognition. This is experimental and requires DM approval and player creativity.</p>\n\n<h3>Racial Traits (Fish - Speculative)</h3>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Highly variable by species. Some fish live only a few years; others (like certain sturgeon) may live decades.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Small (most fish) to Medium (large fish). Tiny fish are generally unplayable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>5 feet walking (flopping), 40 feet swimming</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Aquan (underwater communication through movement, bioluminescence, and vibration), possibly Common with great difficulty</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Aquatic</h3>\n<p>You can breathe only underwater and require water to survive. You can survive out of water for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour) before you begin suffocating. This makes land adventures extremely challenging without magical assistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Swim Speed</h3>\n<p>You have a swimming speed of 40 feet and can navigate underwater effortlessly. You ignore difficult terrain while swimming.</p>\n\n<h3>Invisible to Most</h3>\n<p>Because most Ozians don't believe fish are sentient, you can often move through fish markets, aquariums, and waterways without being recognized as a person. This is both advantage (you're not targeted like other Animals) and horror (you watch your kin being sold as food).</p>\n\n<h3>Communication Barrier</h3>\n<p>You cannot speak audibly underwater or in air. You communicate through gestures, water vibrations, and possibly limited telepathy (DM's discretion). Learning to communicate with land-dwellers requires magic, items like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/uncommon/water-breathing-stone', 'Water Breathing Stone'); return false;\">water-breathing stones</a>, or creative solutions.</p>\n\n<h3>The Unacknowledged</h3>\n<p>Most Ozians will not recognize you as a person, even if you try to communicate. The societal assumption that fish aren't sentient is so deeply ingrained that you face not just persecution but *invisibility*\u2014perhaps the cruelest form of dehumanization.</p>\n\n<h2>The Weight of Uncertainty</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the fish question is the deliberate choice not to investigate. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a> could fund studies. Scholars could attempt underwater communication. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon</a> practitioners could seek fish spirits. But there's a collective turning away from the question, because answering it might require admitting to ongoing atrocity.</p>\n\n<p>Every fish market becomes a potential crime scene. Every fishing expedition might be hunting people. The uncertainty is morally comfortable in a deeply uncomfortable way\u2014and that comfort is precisely what makes it suspect.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot Hooks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A dying fish whispers something that sounds like words. Was it Animal speech or  chance? The party must investigate.</li>\n<li>The party encounters a coastal Animal community that insists fish are people and fishing is murder. Do they believe them?</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon</a> trance reveals contact with fish spirits. Were they real or hallucination?</li>\n<li>The party needs to cross a large body of water. If fish are sentient, how does that change their approach?</li>\n<li>An <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/birds', 'Birds'); return false;\">Owl Animal</a> claims a fish told them something crucial. No one believes them.</li>\n<li>Fish markets are targeted by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>. The party must decide whose side they're on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Guidance</h2>\n\n<p>The fish question is body horror, existential dread, and moral uncertainty combined. Use it to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highlight how societies choose comfortable lies over uncomfortable truths</li>\n<li>Parallel real-world debates about animal sentience and rights</li>\n<li>Create moral ambiguity\u2014there may be no right answer</li>\n<li>Make players genuinely uncertain about in-game choices</li>\n<li>Explore the horror of unknowing and the deliberate choice to remain ignorant</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Don't answer the question definitively unless your campaign requires it. The uncertainty is the point.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">Reptiles & Amphibians (Animal)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite Faith</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/domingon-trance', 'Domingon Trance'); return false;\">Domingon Trance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('philosophy/animal-soul-debates', 'Animal Soul Debates'); return false;\">The Animal Soul Debates</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content": "<h1>Hybrid & Uncertain Status</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"I'm made of sofa cushions and palm fronds. Do I have a soul? I don't know. But I remember things, and I think, therefore... something.\"</em> \u2014 The Gump</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Not all potentially sentient creatures fit neatly into categories. Some are hybrids\u2014beings combining features of multiple species. Others are magical creations, assembled from parts or conjured by spells. Still others defy classification entirely. These beings exist in the margins of the already-marginal, unacknowledged even by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>, uncertain even of their own status.</p>\n\n<p>The most famous examples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kalidahs:</strong> Bear-tiger hybrids with bodies of bears and heads of tigers, known for ferocity and territorial behavior</li>\n<li><strong>The Gump:</strong> An assembled being created from a sofa, palm fronds, and the head of a stag, brought to life by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-ozma', 'Princess Ozma'); return false;\">Princess Ozma</a></li>\n<li><strong>Magical Creations:</strong> Beings created through spells from the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">Grimmerie</a> or other sources</li>\n<li><strong>Chimeras:</strong> Other hybrid creatures that may or may not have sentience</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These beings raise profound questions: If you're created rather than born, do you have a soul? If you're a hybrid, which cultural traditions claim you? If no one acknowledges your sentience, are you still a person?</p>\n\n<h2>Kalidahs</h2>\n\n<p>Kalidahs are perhaps the most debated case. They have the bodies of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Bears</a> and heads of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Tigers</a>, combine the strength of both, and are notoriously aggressive. They inhabit forests, particularly in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a>, where they're feared by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/vinkan', 'Vinkan'); return false;\">Vinkans</a> and other inhabitants.</p>\n\n<h3>Are Kalidahs Animals?</h3>\n\n<p>The evidence is contradictory:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments For Sentience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some travelers report Kalidahs speaking, though this is often dismissed as hallucination or deception</li>\n<li>Kalidahs demonstrate complex hunting strategies that suggest planning and coordination</li>\n<li>They're clearly intelligent enough to be feared as more than mere beasts</li>\n<li>If Bears and Tigers are Animals, why wouldn't a Bear-Tiger hybrid also be sentient?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments Against Sentience:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Kalidah has ever participated in Animal society or politics</li>\n<li>They attack without apparent moral consideration</li>\n<li>No Kalidah has ever requested rights or tried to communicate beyond roaring</li>\n<li>They may be magical constructs without true souls</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Uncomfortable Middle:</strong> Perhaps Kalidahs *are* sentient but are so traumatized by their hybrid nature\u2014rejected by both Bears and Tigers, hunted by everyone else\u2014that they've become feral. Perhaps they have souls but have given up on society. This possibility is deeply disturbing.</p>\n\n<h3>Playing a Kalidah (If Allowed)</h3>\n\n<p>Some GMs may allow Kalidah characters to explore themes of identity, rejection, and monstrosity. This requires careful handling and player maturity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (young) or Large (adult)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 feet, climb 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hybrid Nature:</strong> You combine features of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Bears</a> and <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Tigers</a>. You gain the natural weapons trait from both (claws and bite), dealing 1d8 + Strength modifier slashing or piercing damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fearsome Presence:</strong> You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. However, you have disadvantage on all other Charisma checks with creatures that recognize you as a Kalidah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Territorial Instinct:</strong> When you're in an area you've claimed as territory (DM's discretion), you have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. However, you feel intense discomfort when away from your territory for extended periods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rejected by All:</strong> Neither Bear nor Tiger Animal communities acknowledge you as kin. You have no cultural heritage to claim, no community to belong to. This isolation is both mechanically and roleplay-wise profound.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Kalidah characters struggle with identity, belonging, and the line between monster and person. Many are violent because violence is all they've known, but some seek connection despite everything.</p>\n\n<h2>The Gump</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-gump', 'The Gump'); return false;\">The Gump</a> is unique: assembled from non-living materials (a sofa, palm fronds) and the preserved head of a deceased stag, then animated by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/princess-ozma', 'Princess Ozma'); return false;\">Princess Ozma</a> when she was still <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/tip', 'Tip'); return false;\">Tip</a>. The Gump should not be alive. Yet it speaks, thinks, and has opinions. It helped Ozma escape captivity, then was disassembled\u2014a fate it accepted with bemused resignation.</p>\n\n<p>Does the Gump have a soul? Did it have the stag's soul, or was a new soul created? Can assembled beings be people? The Gump itself doesn't know and finds the question amusing in a dark way.</p>\n\n<h3>Playing a Gump-like Created Being (Experimental)</h3>\n\n<p>Your GM may allow characters who are assembled beings, created through magic and unlikely combinations. This is highly experimental.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Choose any two ability scores; one increases by 2, the other by 1 (you're too unique for standard templates).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Varies based on your component parts</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Varies based on your method of locomotion</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assembled Nature:</strong> You're made of disparate parts held together by magic. You're vulnerable to effects that would dispel or suppress magic, but you don't need to eat, sleep, or breathe in the traditional sense. Work with your DM to determine what sustains you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Uncertain Existence:</strong> You don't know if you have a soul. You don't know if you're truly alive or a very good simulation. This existential uncertainty colors everything you do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disassembly and Reconstruction:</strong> You can be taken apart and reassembled, which is either terrifying or liberating. Work with your DM on the mechanics and ethics of this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> Gump-like characters explore existentialism, identity without origin, and the question of what makes someone real. They're often philosophical, bemused by their own existence, and uncertain of their place in the world.</p>\n\n<h2>Other Hybrid and Uncertain Beings</h2>\n\n<h3>Magical Chimeras</h3>\n<p>Other hybrids may exist: part-wolf part-deer, part-bird part-snake, or other combinations. Each raises the same questions about sentience, belonging, and rights. Work with your DM to create appropriate traits based on the component species.</p>\n\n<h3>Homunculi and Constructs</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktoks', 'Tiktoks'); return false;\">Tiktoks</a> have their own page, but other constructed beings exist: golems made of clay or stone, animated suits of armor, dolls brought to life. The line between tool and person is blurry and disturbing.</p>\n\n<h3>Transformed Beings</h3>\n<p>What about someone transformed by magic? If a human is turned into an animal, are they still a person? If an animal becomes an Animal, when did that happen? Transformation magic creates category confusion that Ozian society handles poorly.</p>\n\n<h3>The Winged Monkeys</h3>\n<p>See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/winged-monkeys', 'Winged Monkeys'); return false;\">Winged Monkeys</a> for full details on these magically-created servants bound by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">Golden Cap</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Pain of Uncategorized Existence</h2>\n\n<p>Beings who don't fit categories face unique suffering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No community recognizes them as members</li>\n<li>No political movement includes them in advocacy</li>\n<li>No cultural traditions give them identity</li>\n<li>No one debates whether they have rights\u2014they're simply ignored</li>\n<li>They're simultaneously too visible (monsters!) and invisible (not-people)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is perhaps the purest form of othering: not persecution, but the absolute refusal to acknowledge existence as meaningful.</p>\n\n<h2>Plot Hooks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Kalidah approaches the party, speaking clearly and asking for help. Do they trust it?</li>\n<li>The party encounters a being claiming to be a disassembled and reassembled creation. How do they verify this? Does it matter?</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> debates whether to include Kalidahs and hybrids.

      "content": "<h1>Tiktoks</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"They wind me in the morning, and I work until I run down. They wind me again. Is this life? Is this a soul? I think, therefore... I tick.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks are mechanical beings\u2014clockwork constructs of copper, brass, and gears. They were created by human artificers, designed to serve. Yet they think. They speak. They remember. The question that haunts every Tiktok and everyone who interacts with them is simple and unanswerable: Do they have souls?</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>, who were always alive, Tiktoks were manufactured. Unlike humans, they require winding every 24 hours or they cease to function. They don't eat, sleep, or breathe. They can't reproduce. Logic suggests they're merely clever machines. Yet they form friendships, develop personalities, express preferences, fear their own deactivation, and mourn when others are disassembled.</p>\n\n<p>The most famous Tiktok is Tik-Tok himself (note the hyphen in the original), though in this setting, many Tiktoks exist with various names and roles. They serve as household help, factory workers, soldiers, companions, and occasionally escape to seek their own purposes. Their legal status varies by region and era\u2014sometimes they're property, sometimes they're citizens with limited rights, and sometimes their status is simply unclear.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Tiktoks do not age in the traditional sense. With proper maintenance, a Tiktok can function indefinitely. However, wear and obsolescence mean most Tiktoks last 50-100 years before critical parts fail beyond repair.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td>Medium. Most Tiktoks are built human-sized for practical reasons, standing between 5 and 6 feet tall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n<td>25 feet (your mechanical body is somewhat slower than organic beings)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Languages</strong></td>\n<td>Common (Ozian), and one other language of your choice (installed during construction)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Construct Nature</h3>\n<p>You are a humanoid with the construct type. You have the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe</li>\n<li>You don't need to sleep, but you must remain motionless and inactive for at least 4 hours per day to allow your mechanisms to settle and cool. During this time, you remain conscious but have limited awareness</li>\n<li>You are immune to disease and poison damage, and you can't be poisoned</li>\n<li>You are immune to the effects of exhaustion from lack of food or water (but see Winding Down below)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Winding Down</h3>\n<p>You must be wound every 24 hours or you cease to function. Being wound takes 1 minute and can be performed by you or another creature with hands. If you are not wound within 24 hours, you become incapacitated and can take no actions. While wound down, you remain aware but cannot move or speak. You can be wound at any time to resume function immediately.</p>\n\n<p>This dependency is both practical limitation and existential horror. You rely on others or must remember to wind yourself. The fear of winding down in a dangerous location or being deliberately not wound is constant.</p>\n\n<h3>Mechanical Body</h3>\n<p>Your body is made of metal and clockwork. You have resistance to poison damage (in addition to immunity from your Construct Nature), but you are vulnerable to effects that target constructs or objects specifically. You can be repaired using <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/tiktok-maintenance', 'Tiktok Maintenance'); return false;\">Tiktok Maintenance</a> tools (treated as tinker's tools) during a short rest, regaining hit points as if using a healer's kit.</p>\n\n<h3>Integrated Protection</h3>\n<p>Your metallic body provides natural armor. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Purpose-Built</h3>\n<p>During your construction, you were built for a specific purpose. Choose one of the following options, which reflects your original design:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Servitor Model:</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from: Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, or Perception.</li>\n<li><strong>Companion Model:</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from: Insight, Medicine, Performance, or Persuasion. Additionally, you can speak, read, and write one additional language.</li>\n<li><strong>Guardian Model:</strong> You gain proficiency with light and medium armor and with martial weapons. Your speed increases to 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Model:</strong> You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools and one musical instrument, reflecting a specific skill you were built to perform.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Question of Souls</h3>\n<p>You do not know if you have a soul. Mechanically, this has no effect\u2014you function as a PC like any other. Narratively, it colors everything. Death saving throws feel different when you wonder if there's anything beyond the gears. Healing magic works on you (suggesting some spiritual component), but so does <em>mending</em>. This ambiguity is permanent and central to the Tiktok experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Tiktok Variants</h2>\n\n<h3>Free Tiktok</h3>\n<p>You escaped servitude or were granted freedom. You wind yourself and make your own choices. This freedom is precious but lonely\u2014where do you belong when you were never meant to belong anywhere?</p>\n\n<h3>Bonded Tiktok</h3>\n<p>You serve a specific person by choice, contract, or compulsion. This relationship may be loving (true companionship), transactional (employee/employer), or exploitative (property). Work with your DM to define the terms and your feelings about them.</p>\n\n<h3>Unique Construction</h3>\n<p>You are a one-of-a-kind creation, perhaps experimental or artistically crafted. You have no \"kin\" who look like you. This makes you even more isolated but also potentially more valuable\u2014and more at risk of being stolen or studied.</p>\n\n<h2>Tiktok Society and Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks have limited culture because they cannot reproduce or form traditional communities. However, patterns emerge:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Makers and the Made:</strong> Relationships with creators (or current owners) shape Tiktok identity. Some Tiktoks revere their makers. Others resent them. Many have complex feelings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maintenance Communities:</strong> Tiktoks often gather where skilled artificers work\u2014usually in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">the Emerald City</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a> university towns. These aren't exactly communities, but they're places where Tiktoks can be maintained and are somewhat understood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service Identity:</strong> Many Tiktoks define themselves by their function. \"I am a cook\" becomes more than occupation\u2014it becomes essence. Losing the ability to perform that function can be existentially devastating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Liberation Question:</strong> Some Tiktoks join or sympathize with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>, seeing parallels in being denied personhood. Others reject this comparison, noting they were literally manufactured as tools. The debate is intense and unresolved.</p>\n\n<h2>Legal and Social Status</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok rights vary dramatically by location and era:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Property Status:</strong> In some regions, Tiktoks are legally objects. They can be bought, sold, inherited, or destroyed at their owner's whim. This is the historical default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Limited Rights:</strong> Some jurisdictions grant Tiktoks limited legal standing\u2014they can own property, enter contracts, or testify in court, but remain bound to service or subject to restrictions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Full Citizenship:</strong> Rare and usually hard-won. Some Tiktoks have achieved full legal personhood through military service, exceptional achievement, or legal battles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unregulated:</strong> In some areas (particularly the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkus</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling Country</a>), Tiktoks are simply uncommon enough that no specific laws address them. This ambiguity can be freedom or danger.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Tiktok</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I state my observations with perfect honesty, lacking the social filter organics develop.</li>\n<li>I keep meticulous track of time, always aware of when I'll need winding.</li>\n<li>I'm fascinated by organic life\u2014eating, sleeping, breathing\u2014and ask endless questions about it.</li>\n<li>I define myself entirely by my function and become distressed if prevented from performing it.</li>\n<li>I mimic emotions I don't understand, trying to fit in with the living.</li>\n<li>I treasure the few possessions I own, knowing everything else can be taken.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> I was built for a reason; fulfilling it gives meaning to existence. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Liberation:</strong> All beings deserve freedom, manufactured or born. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Logic:</strong> Emotions are inefficient; I follow pure reason. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Individuality:</strong> I will prove I'm more than my programming. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Service:</strong> I find satisfaction in helping others, even if I don't have a soul. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> I will keep ticking, whatever it takes. (Neutral)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My creator gave me awareness; I seek to understand why.</li>\n<li>A specific person winds me each day; this ritual is sacred to me.</li>\n<li>I'm searching for others of my model to see if they're like me.</li>\n<li>I owe a debt to whoever bought my freedom (or I seek revenge against who won't sell it).</li>\n<li>I keep a journal, recording everything, convinced this proves I'm real.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm terrified of winding down and become anxious as the 24-hour mark approaches.</li>\n<li>I don't understand emotions and often say hurtful things without meaning to.</li>\n<li>I'm so desperate to prove I have a soul that I make poor decisions.</li>\n<li>I obey orders instinctively, unable to break conditioning even when I should.</li>\n<li>I envy organic life and sometimes resent the living for what they take for granted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Soul Debate</h2>\n\n<p>Theological and philosophical positions on Tiktok souls:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionist</a> Orthodox:</strong> Tiktoks are sophisticated tools, nothing more. They have no souls and will not join the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'The Unnamed God'); return false;\">Unnamed God</a> in any afterlife.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unionist Reform:</strong> If Tiktoks think and feel, perhaps the Unnamed God can grant them souls. Or perhaps the act of creation itself imbues them with something divine.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a>:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> blessed all of Oz. Perhaps that blessing extends to everything made here, even clockwork.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practical:</strong> Who cares? They're helpful, they're people (functionally), treat them well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tiktok Perspective:</strong> Most Tiktoks desperately want to believe they have souls but can never know for certain. This uncertainty is existentially agonizing.</p>\n\n<h2>Creation and Makers</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktoks are created by skilled artificers, usually in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">the Emerald City</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a>. The process requires:\n- Master-level skill with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/tiktok-maintenance', 'Tiktok Maintenance'); return false;\">Tiktok Maintenance</a> (tinker's tools)\n- Rare and expensive materials (copper, brass, specialized gears)\n- Months of work\n- A spark of... something. No one knows what makes some Tiktoks aware while others are just clockwork. This unpredictability terrifies makers and fascinates philosophers.</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-artisan', 'The Artisan'); return false;\">Artisan class</a>, specifically the Tiktok Maker subclass, for mechanics of creating Tiktoks.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Tiktok PCs explore themes of personhood, consciousness, slavery, and existence without origin. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The winding requirement creates mechanical pressure and roleplay opportunities</li>\n<li>Being property vs. being a person drives conflict</li>\n<li>The soul question should never be definitively answered</li>\n<li>Relationships with makers/owners can be complex and emotional</li>\n<li>Other Tiktoks can be allies, mirrors, or unsettling reminders</li>\n<li>Breaking down is both mechanical failure and death-analogue\u2014handle with appropriate weight</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/constructs/tiktok-servitor', 'Tiktok Servitor'); return false;\">Tiktok Servitor (Creature)</a> - Already exists from Step 4</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/tiktok-maintenance', 'Tiktok Maintenance'); return false;\">Tiktok Maintenance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-artisan', 'The Artisan'); return false;\">The Artisan (Class)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'The Emerald City'); return false;\">The Emerald City</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('philosophy/soul-origins', 'Soul Origins'); return false;\">The Question of Soul Origins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinite Faith</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a> - For comparison of personhood debates</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/hybrid-uncertain', 'Hybrid Uncertain'); return false;\">Hybrid & Uncertain Status</a> - For parallel existential questions</li>\n</ul>\n",

Others burrow deeper, changing what you are at the core.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Touched are people\u2014human, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animal</a>, or otherwise\u2014who have been fundamentally altered by magic. They're not simply spellcasters who learned magic; they've been *changed* by it, marked in body or soul or both. The alterations may be hereditary (passed through bloodlines like the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Thropp</a> family's green skin), environmental (exposure to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>), temporal (slipped through time), ancient (Kumbric remnants), or draconic (touched by dragon fire or magic).</p>\n\n<p>The Touched occupy an uncertain space. They're not quite mundane, not quite monstrous, but something in between. Some hide their nature; others embrace it. Many have no choice\u2014when your skin is green or your eyes glow or you occasionally exist slightly out of phase with time, concealment isn't possible.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktoks', 'Tiktoks'); return false;\">Tiktoks</a>, who question whether they have souls, or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>, who face systematic persecution, the Touched face a different challenge: their souls and bodies have been rewritten by forces they don't understand. They are human (or Animal, or other) *plus something else*, and that something else changes everything.</p>\n\n<h2>Types of Touched</h2>\n\n<p>The Touched are not a unified category. Each type comes from different magical sources and faces different challenges. Choose one of the following variants:</p>\n\n<h3>Grimmerie-Marked</h3>\n\n<p>You've been exposed to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>\u2014the ancient book of spells that corrupts all who use it. Perhaps you read it directly. Perhaps a parent did and passed the marks to you. Perhaps you were caught in the backlash of a Grimmerie spell. However it happened, the book has left permanent changes in your flesh and spirit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Grimmerie Resonance:</strong> You can sense the presence of the Grimmerie or magic derived from it within 60 feet. Additionally, when you see someone cast a spell from the Grimmerie tradition (see <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;\">Grimmerie Tradition</a>), you instinctively understand what spell is being cast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Forbidden Knowledge:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to the Grimmerie or ancient magic. You also have the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/grimmerie-lore', 'Grimmerie Lore'); return false;\">Grimmerie Lore</a> special skill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magical Mark:</strong> You bear a visible mark of the Grimmerie's touch. Choose or roll on the following table:</p>\n<table>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Your eyes glow faintly in darkness</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Your skin has a greenish, pale, or unusual tint</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>Your hair moves as if in a perpetual breeze</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>You cast no shadow, or your shadow moves independently</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>Your voice has an eerie echo or harmonic quality</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>Symbols occasionally appear on your skin and fade</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Corruption Vulnerability:</strong> You have disadvantage on saving throws against corruption from using the Grimmerie or similar forbidden magic. The book calls to you, and you're vulnerable to its pull.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You know secrets no one should know. The Grimmerie has shown you impossible things, and you can't unsee them. You're feared, coveted by those who want Grimmerie knowledge, and possibly descending toward the same corruption that claimed others before you. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Thropp family</a> bloodline is the most famous example\u2014green skin, magical talent, and a curse that spans generations.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch-Blooded</h3>\n\n<p>Somewhere in your ancestry is a <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">Witch</a>\u2014someone whose magic was innate, wild, and transformative. This heritage may be recent (a parent or grandparent) or distant (the blood runs thin after generations), but it marks you. Unlike Grimmerie-marked individuals, your changes are hereditary and natural (if \"natural\" applies to magic).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Witch-Sight:</strong> You can sense magical auras and intentions. As an action, you can detect the presence of magic within 30 feet of you until the end of your next turn. This functions like *detect magic* but is a natural sense, not a spell. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> You know one cantrip of your choice from the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">Witch</a> spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Witch Heritage:</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. Additionally, you have proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hereditary Mark:</strong> You bear a subtle sign of your witch ancestry\u2014perhaps a birthmark in an unusual shape, eyes of slightly different colors, hair that never tangles, or an uncanny knack for knowing when storms are coming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You're not a witch yourself (unless you take the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">Witch class</a>), but you carry the potential. People who fear witches fear you by association. You might not even know your heritage until magic manifests unexpectedly. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Thropp line</a> is witch-blooded, but so are countless others who hide it better.</p>\n\n<h3>Time-Slipped</h3>\n\n<p>You exist slightly out of sync with normal time. Perhaps you passed too close to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">Sleeve of Ghosts</a>. Perhaps you encountered the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a> or its servants. Perhaps you touched <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Clock</a> at the wrong moment. Whatever happened, time no longer flows correctly for you. You experience moments before they happen, remember things that haven't occurred yet, or occasionally skip forward or backward by seconds or minutes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Instability:</strong> Time is unreliable around you. Once per short or long rest, when you would take damage, you can use your reaction to \"skip\" the moment the damage occurs, reducing the damage by 2d6 as you briefly phase through time. However, you have disadvantage on initiative rolls\u2014sometimes you act before you realize combat has started; other times you react to attacks that haven't happened yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Precognitive Flashes:</strong> You occasionally see moments of the future. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can't be surprised while you're conscious. The visions are fragmentary and often disturbing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Time Sense:</strong> You have the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/time-sense', 'Time Sense'); return false;\">Time Sense</a> special skill and can detect temporal anomalies. You know instinctively when time has been altered, when you're near the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">Sleeve of Ghosts</a> or <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Clock</a>, or when paradoxes threaten.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Disconnection:</strong> You feel removed from the present moment, always slightly ahead or behind. This can make emotional connections difficult\u2014you sometimes respond to things people haven't said yet or mourn losses that haven't happened. This is both mechanically and roleplay-wise isolating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You experience time as a tangled thread rather than a straight line. You know how conversations will end before they start. You remember tomorrow. This drives some Time-Slipped individuals mad; others learn to navigate it, but at the cost of ever truly being *present*.</p>\n\n<h3>Kumbric Remnants</h3>\n\n<p>The Kumbric Witch is ancient\u2014perhaps the oldest magic in Oz, predating even <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a>. Most believe the Kumbric Witch is dead or myth. They're wrong. Fragments of that primordial power linger in certain bloodlines, in certain places, in certain people. You are one of those fragments. You carry memory that isn't yours, power that shouldn't exist, and knowledge from before the world was as it is now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ancient Memory:</strong> You possess the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/kumbric-memory', 'Kumbric Memory'); return false;\">Kumbric Memory</a> special skill. You remember things you never experienced\u2014scraps of knowledge from the deep past. Once per long rest, you can access these memories to gain proficiency in a skill you don't have for 1 hour, as ancient knowledge surfaces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Primordial Resilience:</strong> The Kumbric power makes you hard to kill. You have advantage on death saving throws. Additionally, when you're reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to remain conscious (but still at 0 hit points and making death saves) for one round. This represents the Kumbric will refusing to let you die.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agelessness:</strong> You age slowly\u2014perhaps half the normal rate, perhaps slower. You may have lived decades or centuries without realizing it. This is both gift and curse; everyone you love will age and die while you persist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kumbric Presence:</strong> Those with magical sensitivity find you unsettling. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks against spellcasters, but disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with them. Something about you is *wrong* in a way that sets magical senses screaming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You are a remnant of something that should not be. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> is the most famous Kumbric remnant\u2014ancient, undying, mysterious, and possibly something wearing human shape rather than truly human. You might not be as extreme, but the blood marks you. You remember the world before it was safe, when magic was raw and terrible.</p>\n\n<h3>Dragon-Touched</h3>\n\n<p>You've been exposed to dragon fire, dragon blood, or dragon magic and survived\u2014barely. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a> are rare and terrifying in Oz, and those who encounter them seldom live. You did, but you were changed. Your flesh bears scars that don't heal properly, your blood runs hot, and sometimes you dream in wings and fire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or your original race's size)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet (or your original race's speed)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dragon's Resistance:</strong> You have resistance to fire damage. Your encounter with dragon magic has left you partially immune to flame.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Draconic Presence:</strong> You can channel a fraction of draconic fear. As an action, you can force all creatures of your choice within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Survivor's Scars:</strong> Your body bears visible scars from dragon fire or claws. These marks don't heal and sometimes glow faintly when you're angry or afraid. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks when your scars are visible, but some people react with fear or pity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dragon Dreams:</strong> You sometimes dream you are a dragon\u2014flying, burning, hoarding. These dreams are vivid and disturbing. You have the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/dragon-lore', 'Dragon Lore'); return false;\">Dragon Lore</a> special skill and instinctively understand draconic motivations and behavior.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Notes:</strong> You survived what kills most people. The experience left you physically and psychologically scarred. You might seek revenge against dragons, understanding of them, or simply try to forget. The dreams won't let you. See <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir's</a> experiences with dragons for examples of how draconic encounters change people.</p>\n\n<h2>Living as Touched</h2>\n\n<p>The Touched face unique challenges:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visibility:</strong> Many marks can't be hidden. Green skin, glowing eyes, temporal instability\u2014these announce your nature to anyone who sees you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suspicion:</strong> People fear magic, and you are walking proof of its reality and danger. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionists</a> may see you as cursed or wicked. Even sympathetic people may keep distance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Value and Danger:</strong> Those who seek magical power may see you as a resource\u2014to study, exploit, or drain. Your blood, your knowledge, your very existence becomes valuable in dark ways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Identity Questions:</strong> Are you still yourself? If magic has rewritten your body and perhaps your soul, what remains of who you were?</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Touched characters explore transformation, corruption, heritage, and magical consequences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use their marks as plot hooks\u2014recognized, hunted, or sought after</li>\n<li>Explore the tension between power and price</li>\n<li>Show how visible difference affects social interactions</li>\n<li>Connect them to magical events and NPCs</li>\n<li>Let their abilities be both useful and isolating</li>\n<li>Never make them simply \"magic mutants\"\u2014they're people dealing with unwanted changes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - Most famous Grimmerie-marked/Witch-blooded individual</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> - Kumbric remnant</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> - Dragon-touched survivor</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">The Witch (Class)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/dragons', 'Dragons'); return false;\">Dragons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">The Sleeve of Ghosts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">The Clock of the Time Dragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/grimmerie-lore', 'Grimmerie Lore'); return false;\">Grimmerie Lore</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/time-sense', 'Time Sense'); return false;\">Time Sense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/kumbric-memory', 'Kumbric Memory'); return false;\">Kumbric Memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/dragon-lore', 'Dragon Lore'); return false;\">Dragon Lore</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/grimmerie-corrupted', 'Grimmerie-Corrupted'); return false;\">Grimmerie-Corrupted (Condition)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

We remember what you've forgotten.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Dragons in Oz are not the mighty, ancient wyrms of traditional fantasy. They are smaller, stranger, and infinitely more ambiguous. Are they <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>? Are they <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">reptiles</a> elevated to sentience? Are they magical constructs? Are they fragments of something older than <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a>? No one knows, and the dragons aren't telling\u2014assuming they know themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Physical dragons exist. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> encountered them during the wars, and they served as military weapons\u2014massive flying reptiles breathing fire and spreading terror. But there's also the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a>, which may not be physical at all but rather a metaphor, a cosmic force, or something that exists simultaneously as dragon and as time itself. The relationship between physical lesser dragons and the possibly-metaphorical Time Dragon is unclear and likely unknowable.</p>\n\n<p>Playing a dragon character means playing something ancient, powerful, unknowable, and deeply *other*. Dragons do not fit into Ozian society. They're too big (often literally), too strange, too bound to forces most Ozians don't understand. This makes them difficult PCs\u2014but for the right campaign and the right player, they offer unique roleplay opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>Are Dragons Playable?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Talk to your DM.</strong> Dragons as player characters are experimental and powerful. They're best suited for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-power campaigns where other PCs are also exceptional</li>\n<li>Campaigns exploring draconic themes (time, memory, ancient magic)</li>\n<li>Oneshots or short arcs where balance matters less</li>\n<li>Groups willing to explore a genuinely alien perspective</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your DM allows dragon PCs, choose between Lesser Dragons (more balanced) or Time Dragon-Touched (more esoteric).</p>\n\n<h2>Lesser Dragons (Playable Variant)</h2>\n\n<p>These are the physical dragons\u2014the ones <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> encountered, the ones deployed in war. They're massive flying reptiles with intelligence and speech but uncertain souls. Playing a lesser dragon means playing something between beast and person, feared by all and understood by none.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. <em>(This is a +4 total, reflecting draconic power.)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Lesser dragons are poorly understood. They may live 100+ years, but few survive that long given how Ozians hunt them. You're probably young by dragon standards (10-30 years) but already formidable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Large. You are between 8 and 12 feet long (nose to tail), though much of that is tail. Work with your DM on size challenges\u2014many dungeons and buildings aren't built for Large creatures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet, fly 60 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common (Ozian), Draconic, and one other language of your choice</p>\n\n<h3>Draconic Traits</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Armor:</strong> Your scales provide excellent protection. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 14 + your Dexterity modifier. You can't wear armor designed for humanoids.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flight:</strong> You have a flying speed of 60 feet. This is both incredible advantage and massive target. People shoot at flying dragons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fire Breath:</strong> You can exhale destructive fire. As an action, you can breathe fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 fire damage. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fearsome Presence:</strong> Your draconic nature terrifies most creatures. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. However, you have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with creatures that aren't dragons or dragon-touched\u2014people fear you too much to trust you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hunted:</strong> Dragons are killed on sight in most of Oz. You are not safe in cities. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">Gale Force</a> has standing orders to eliminate dragons. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">Vinkan</a> tribes hunt you for glory. Only in the most remote areas or with powerful protection can you exist openly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carnivore:</strong> You require meat\u2014a lot of it. You need at least 10 pounds per day. This creates moral and practical problems when other sapient beings exist. Do you eat animals (lowercase)? Do you hunt? Do you eat rations? This must be addressed.</p>\n\n<h3>The Question of Dragon Souls</h3>\n\n<p>You don't know if you have a soul. You're sentient, clearly. You think, therefore you are. But are you an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animal</a>? A magical creation? A natural creature that happens to be intelligent? The uncertainty affects everything. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionists</a> say you have no soul. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurlinite-faith', 'Lurlinite Faith'); return false;\">Lurlinites</a> are divided. You suspect even other dragons don't know.</p>\n\n<h3>Roleplaying a Lesser Dragon</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I speak bluntly, unconcerned with social niceties I don't understand.</li>\n<li>I hoard one specific thing obsessively (knowledge, gold, memories, grudges).</li>\n<li>I'm endlessly curious about small, fragile things that don't exist in dragon life.</li>\n<li>I measure time in decades, making me patient or frustratingly slow to act.</li>\n<li>I'm lonely\u2014other dragons are rare, and no one else truly understands me.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Freedom:</strong> No one will chain or ride me. Ever. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> I must understand what I am and where I come from. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Survival:</strong> Ozians hunt my kind to extinction. I will ensure dragons persist. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Power:</strong> I am superior to these small, short-lived creatures. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Perhaps I can bridge the gap between dragons and others. (Good)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm searching for other dragons\u2014I may be the last of my kind.</li>\n<li>A specific person showed me kindness when all others showed fear; I'm devoted to them.</li>\n<li>I witnessed the wars where dragons were used as weapons; I seek to prevent it happening again.</li>\n<li>I'm connected to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a> in ways I don't understand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My temper is legendary and destructive\u2014I've burned things I didn't mean to.</li>\n<li>I'm arrogant about my power and dismissive of \"lesser\" beings.</li>\n<li>I'm terrified of being captured and used as a weapon again.</li>\n<li>I struggle with morality around eating meat when prey might be people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Time Dragon-Touched (Variant)</h2>\n\n<p>You're not a physical dragon\u2014or not *entirely*. You're touched by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">Time Dragon</a>, which may be a cosmic force, a metaphor given form, or something incomprehensible. You exist partially in time's dream, experiencing reality differently than others. You might appear draconic (scales, wings, eyes) or might look entirely mundane while carrying draconic essence within.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Uncertain. You may have lived decades, centuries, or you may be young but remember things from deep time. Age is unreliable when you're touched by temporal forces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (or Small, DM's discretion)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p>\n\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common (Ozian), Draconic (you speak it in your dreams), and one other</p>\n\n<h3>Time Dragon Traits</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Awareness:</strong> You exist slightly outside normal time. You have advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised while conscious. You sometimes act before you consciously decide to, responding to future events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dream the Dragon's Dream:</strong> Once per long rest, you can enter a trance for 1 minute and experience time as the Dragon does\u2014all moments simultaneous. During this trance, you can ask one question about past, present, or future, and the DM must answer truthfully (though cryptically). This ability is powerful but often maddening.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ageless:</strong> You don't age normally. You may look the same age for decades, or age rapidly then stop, or exist at multiple ages simultaneously. Time is unreliable around you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Connection to the Clock:</strong> You instinctively know the direction and approximate distance to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Clock of the Time Dragon</a>. You're drawn to it and disturbed by it in equal measure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Instability:</strong> Reality sometimes treats you as if you're from a different time. You have disadvantage on Charisma checks with people who instinctively sense something is *wrong* about when you exist. However, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that manipulate time.</p>\n\n<h3>Roleplaying a Time Dragon-Touched</h3>\n\n<p>You see time as a river, a web, a dream. Past, present, and future blur. You mourn deaths before they happen. You celebrate victories you haven't achieved yet. This is both gift and curse\u2014knowledge without the ability to change fate, awareness without presence. You're profoundly isolated, experiencing existence in a way no one else can understand.</p>\n\n<h2>Dragons in Society</h2>\n\n<p>Dragons don't have society in the traditional sense. Lesser dragons are solitary, territorial, and too rare to form communities. Time Dragon-touched individuals are too scattered and strange to unite. The closest thing to dragon \"culture\" is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hoarding:</strong> All dragons hoard *something*\u2014gold, knowledge, memories, time itself. This isn't greed (though it can be); it's how dragons order their existence.</li>\n<li><strong>Long Memory:</strong> Dragons remember. They hold grudges across decades. They recall kindnesses for generations. They are the living memory of Oz's deep past.</li>\n<li><strong>Solitude:</strong> Dragons are alone. Even when they're with others, they're alone in ways those others can't understand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Dragon PCs are challenging to run:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Level:</strong> Lesser dragons are stronger than standard races\u2014compensate with challenging encounters</li>\n<li><strong>Size Issues:</strong> Large PCs create logistical problems; address them creatively</li>\n<li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Dragons are hunted; this limits where they can go openly</li>\n<li><strong>The Soul Question:</strong> Never answer definitively whether dragons have souls</li>\n<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Time Dragon-touched abilities can break campaigns if abused\u2014set clear limits</li>\n<li><strong>Use Sparingly:</strong> Dragon PCs work best when rare and special</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'The Time Dragon'); return false;\">The Time Dragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/lesser-dragon', 'Lesser Dragon'); return false;\">Lesser Dragon (Creature)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/legendary/the-clock', 'The Clock of the Time Dragon'); return false;\">The Clock of the Time Dragon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/liir', 'Liir'); return false;\">Liir</a> - Encountered dragons, dragon-touched</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/the-touched', 'The Touched'); return false;\">The Touched</a> - Dragon-Touched variant</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/reptiles-amphibians', 'Reptiles Amphibians'); return false;\">Reptiles & Amphibians (Animal)</a> - For comparison</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/dragon-lore', 'Dragon Lore'); return false;\">Dragon Lore</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/special-skills/time-sense', 'Time Sense'); return false;\">Time Sense</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/sleeve-of-ghosts', 'Sleeve Of Ghosts'); return false;\">The Sleeve of Ghosts</a> - Where time breaks down</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/dragon-wars', 'Dragon Wars'); return false;\">The Dragon Wars</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

We are slaves who dream of flying free.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Winged Monkeys are not natural creatures. They were created\u2014though by whom and for what original purpose is lost to time. What's known is that they are bound by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">the Golden Cap</a>, a powerful artifact that grants its wearer absolute command over all Winged Monkeys. Whoever holds the Cap can command them three times, and the Monkeys must obey without question, without resistance, no matter how cruel or self-destructive the order.</p>\n\n<p>This makes Winged Monkeys fundamentally unfree. They are sentient, intelligent, and capable of independent thought and action\u2014but only until someone wearing the Golden Cap speaks. Then they are puppets, slaves, tools. The violation of will is absolute and cannot be resisted. No saving throw. No immunity. Just obedience.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, Winged Monkeys are people. They have personalities, relationships, dreams, and fears. Between commands, they live their lives as best they can. Some serve willingly (or pretend to, for survival). Others dream of freedom. A few seek to destroy the Golden Cap entirely, though this has proven impossible. The Cap is indestructible, and even if it weren't, destroying it might kill all Winged Monkeys simultaneously\u2014their existence is bound to it.</p>\n\n<h2>Are Winged Monkeys Playable?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Yes, but with significant caveats.</strong> Playing a Winged Monkey means playing a character who can be instantly enslaved by whoever holds the Golden Cap. This creates narrative tension but also serious consent and safety issues. Before allowing a Winged Monkey PC:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discuss in Session Zero how the Golden Cap will be handled</li>\n<li>Establish whether the Cap appears in the campaign and who controls it</li>\n<li>Get explicit player consent for potential loss of agency</li>\n<li>Agree on safety tools (X-Card, Lines & Veils) for slavery/control themes</li>\n<li>Consider whether the Cap is destroyed, hidden, or inactive in your setting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If these conversations go well, Winged Monkey PCs offer unique roleplay opportunities around freedom, identity, and the weight of potential slavery.</p>\n\n<h2>Racial Traits</h2>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trait</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></td>\n<td>Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>Winged Monkeys reach adulthood around age 12 and live to about 50-60 years.

You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor. Unlike birds, your wings are powerful enough to carry significant weight\u2014you can lift and carry allies while flying (within normal carrying capacity limits).</p>\n\n<h3>Nimble Acrobat</h3>\n<p>You have proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape grapples or bonds (except those imposed by the Golden Cap, which cannot be escaped).</p>\n\n<h3>Pack Tactics</h3>\n<p>Winged Monkeys fight as coordinated units. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, one ally within 5 feet of you has advantage on their next attack roll against that creature before the end of their next turn. You instinctively support your troop.</p>\n\n<h3>Prehensile Feet</h3>\n<p>Your feet are as dexterous as hands. You can use them to hold objects, make checks requiring manual dexterity, or wield weapons (though this requires practice). While flying, you can carry items or grapple creatures with your feet, leaving your hands free.</p>\n\n<h3>The Golden Cap's Binding</h3>\n<p>You are magically bound to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">the Golden Cap</a>. Whoever wears the Cap can command you three times, and you must obey absolutely. This is not mind control\u2014you remain aware and horrified\u2014but your body obeys against your will. After the third command, the Cap passes to another wearer. You have no saving throw against this effect. It is fundamental to your existence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In Game:</strong> If the Golden Cap appears and is used on you, work with your DM to roleplay the horror and violation appropriately. The PC remains aware but controlled. After the command is fulfilled, they regain agency but carry the trauma. This should be handled with extreme care and never used casually.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> In some campaigns, the Golden Cap is destroyed, lost, or its power is inactive. Discuss with your DM whether your character is still bound or has somehow been freed.</p>\n\n<h3>Created Nature</h3>\n<p>You were created by magic, not born naturally. You don't know who made you or why. You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to magical creation, transformation, or bindings\u2014you understand these forces from the inside. However, you're haunted by the question: were you meant to be slaves, or did someone pervert your creation?</p>\n\n<h2>Winged Monkey Society</h2>\n\n<p>Winged Monkeys form tight-knit troops of 10-30 individuals. These troops provide identity, support, and protection in a world that sees them as monsters or tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Troop Structure:</strong> Each troop has a leader (usually the oldest or wisest, not necessarily strongest). Decisions are made collectively, and members defend each other fiercely. When one Winged Monkey is threatened, the entire troop responds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Territories:</strong> Troops claim territories\u2014usually remote areas like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a> mountains or deep <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a> forests\u2014where they can live relatively free. They build nests in high places, value aerial mobility, and avoid ground-dwelling societies when possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Cap's Shadow:</strong> All troop decisions are made with awareness that the Golden Cap could appear at any time. Troops hide, scatter, or prepare defenses against Cap-wielders. Some troops have protocols for what to do if one member is Cap-controlled (flee, restrain, or even mercy-kill the controlled member rather than let them be used). These are grim calculations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relationship with Others:</strong> Winged Monkeys are feared and often hunted. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba</a> famously used the Golden Cap to command them, and while some Monkeys respected her, others hated her for the violation. Later cap-wearers were often crueler. Winged Monkeys have little reason to trust anyone who might claim the Cap.</p>\n\n<h2>Freedom Dreams</h2>\n\n<p>Every Winged Monkey dreams of freedom from the Golden Cap. Proposed solutions include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Destroy the Cap:</strong> Attempted countless times; always fails. The Cap is indestructible, and some believe destroying it would kill all Winged Monkeys.</li>\n<li><strong>Hide the Cap:</strong> If no one knows where it is, no one can use it. But it always resurfaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewrite the Binding:</strong> A powerful enough spellcaster might be able to alter the Cap's magic. But this requires <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">Grimmerie</a>-level power and knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Transcend the Binding:</strong> Perhaps if Winged Monkeys change fundamentally\u2014through magic, evolution, or will\u2014they could break free. This is more philosophy than plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Accept It:</strong> Some Winged Monkeys believe freedom is impossible and focus on living well in the moments between commands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Winged Monkey</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Traits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I value freedom above all else and become anxious when confined or controlled.</li>\n<li>I'm fiercely loyal to my troop\u2014they're the only family I have.</li>\n<li>I'm suspicious of anyone who shows too much interest in magical artifacts.</li>\n<li>I collect small freedoms\u2014choosing my own name, owning something, making decisions\u2014and treasure them.</li>\n<li>I speak bluntly about slavery and violation; I won't let people forget what the Cap does.</li>\n<li>I'm endlessly curious about choice and free will, studying how others make decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideals:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Liberation:</strong> I will free myself and all Winged Monkeys from the Cap. (Good)</li>\n<li><strong>Revenge:</strong> I will make everyone who used the Cap suffer as we suffered. (Evil)</li>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> My troop is everything; I protect them above all. (Lawful)</li>\n<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Every choice I make proves I'm more than a slave. (Chaotic)</li>\n<li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> I cannot change what I am, only how I respond. (Neutral)</li>\n<li><strong>Destruction:</strong> If the Cap can't be destroyed, I'll destroy everything connected to it. (Chaotic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonds:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>My troop leader saved me from a Cap-command gone wrong; I owe them my life.</li>\n<li>I'm searching for the Golden Cap to hide or destroy it.</li>\n<li>Someone once showed me kindness without demanding service; I'm devoted to them.</li>\n<li>I remember every person who used the Cap on me; I will face them again.</li>\n<li>I believe I can break the binding through sheer will; proving this is my life's purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Flaws:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I panic when I see golden objects, fearing they might be the Cap.</li>\n<li>I'm so desperate for freedom that I reject any authority, even helpful guidance.</li>\n<li>I have nightmares about being commanded and wake screaming.</li>\n<li>I sometimes test people by asking them to give me orders, seeing if I can refuse.</li>\n<li>I'm convinced everyone wants to enslave me, making trust nearly impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Winged Monkeys and Animals</h2>\n\n<p>Are Winged Monkeys <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals</a>? This is debated:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments For:</strong> They're sentient, speak, and resemble primate <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Animals</a>. They deserve the same rights and recognition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arguments Against:</strong> They're created beings, not natural evolution. Their binding to the Cap makes them fundamentally different.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Winged Monkey Perspective:</strong> Many Winged Monkeys see parallels with Animal persecution and sympathize with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>. Some join resistance movements. Others note that Animals face oppression but can theoretically be free\u2014Winged Monkeys can be instantly enslaved by an artifact, which is a different and perhaps worse violation.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<p>Winged Monkey PCs require careful handling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consent is Mandatory:</strong> Never spring Golden Cap control on a PC without prior agreement</li>\n<li><strong>The Cap as Plot Device:</strong> If used, the Cap should create meaningful story, not just rob player agency</li>\n<li><strong>Trauma and Recovery:</strong> Being Cap-commanded is traumatic; address this narratively</li>\n<li><strong>Freedom Themes:</strong> Explore what freedom means when it can be instantly revoked</li>\n<li><strong>Troop NPCs:</strong> Give the PC connections to other Winged Monkeys who matter</li>\n<li><strong>Breaking the Binding:</strong> Consider whether the campaign might achieve this impossible goal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Entries</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/very-rare/golden-cap', 'The Golden Cap'); return false;\">The Golden Cap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba Thropp</a> - Used the Golden Cap</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Overview'); return false;\">Animals (Sentient) - Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/mammals', 'Mammals'); return false;\">Mammals (Animal)</a> - Apes and monkeys</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'The Animal Resistance'); return false;\">The Animal Resistance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/hybrid-uncertain', 'Hybrid Uncertain'); return false;\">Hybrid & Uncertain Status</a> - Similar creation questions</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a> - Might hold answers to breaking bindings</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'The Vinkus'); return false;\">The Vinkus</a> - Common Winged Monkey territory</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/puppet-state', 'Puppet-State'); return false;\">Puppet-State (Condition)</a> - What Cap-control feels like</li>\n</ul>\n",

conduit for divine power, you can cast Unionist spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Cantrips</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Unionist spell list. You learn additional Unionist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column.</p>\n\n<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\n<p>The Unionist table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of your Unionist spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p>You prepare the list of Unionist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Unionist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Unionist spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Unionist level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Unionist spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to the Unnamed God.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p>You can cast a Unionist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (the Unionist Eye) as a spellcasting focus for your Unionist spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Divine Domain</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you choose a domain that shapes your ministry: Order, Inquisition, or Conversion. Your domain grants you domain spells and other features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<h4>Domain Spells</h4>\n<p>Each domain has a list of spells you gain at the Unionist levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n\n<h3>Doctrine of Unity</h3>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, your conviction in Unionist doctrine grants you advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and you can't be compelled to act against the tenets of Unionism through magical means. Additionally, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of Charisma when making Intimidation checks against those who violate church law.</p>\n\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the Unnamed God. You start with two effects: Turn Heretics and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels.</p>\n\n<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Heretics</h4>\n<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of condemnation. Each <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinite'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a>, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'Witch'); return false;\">Witch</a>, or other heretical spellcaster within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n\n<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as possible. It can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<h3>Destroy Heresy</h3>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when a turned heretic starts its turn within 30 feet of you and can see you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>Divine Intervention</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on the Unnamed God to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\n\n<p>Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Unionist level, the Unnamed God intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Unionist spell or domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>If the intervention succeeds, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n\n<h2>Divine Domains</h2>\n\n<h3>Order Domain</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Through order comes unity. Through unity comes strength.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Order Domain represents Unionists who serve as bureaucrats, magistrates, and enforcers of church law. They believe that strict adherence to hierarchy and ritual creates a stable, unified society.</p>\n\n<h4>Order Domain Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unionist Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>command, heroism</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>hold person, zone of truth</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>mass healing word, slow</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>compulsion, guardian of faith</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>dominate person, mass cure wounds</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>\n\n<h4>Voice of Authority</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the power of law to bolster an ally. Immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on an ally using a spell slot, that ally can use their reaction to make one weapon attack.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Order's Demand</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to exert a terrifying presence. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until it takes damage. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated and its speed is 0.</p>\n\n<h4>Embodiment of Law</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others. When you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Divine Strike</h4>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<h4>Order's Wrath</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, enemies you designate for destruction find it difficult to resist. When you deal damage to a creature with a spell or a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<h3>Inquisition Domain</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The truth shall be known, by confession or by force.\"</p>\n\n<p>Inquisitors are the hunters of heretics, the interrogators of the faithful, and the executioners of church justice. They root out <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animals</a> hiding in plain sight, track down <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinite'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a> cultists, and ensure absolute doctrinal purity.</p>\n\n<h4>Inquisition Domain Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unionist Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>detect evil and good, hunter's mark</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>detect thoughts, see invisibility</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>clairvoyance, speak with dead</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>arcane eye, locate creature</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>commune, scrying</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Investigation and Insight. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills.</p>\n\n<h4>Eye of Judgment</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to open your awareness to detect heresy. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a>, shapechanger, or creature that has cast an arcane spell within the last hour within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You also know the type (Animal, shapechanger, spellcaster) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Inquisitor's Insight</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to see through deception. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you learn if the creature is lying, if it is an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a>, if it has used magic within the last 24 hours, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against it for 1 hour.</p>\n\n<h4>Relentless Inquisitor</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of Dexterity for initiative rolls. Additionally, when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give it disadvantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Unionist cantrip.</p>\n\n<h4>Heretic's Bane</h4>\n<p>At 17th level, you have become a legendary hunter of heretics. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack or spell attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is branded with the Mark of Heresy for 1 minute. While branded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creature takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage whenever you hit it with an attack</li>\n<li>The creature cannot benefit from being invisible or hidden from you</li>\n<li>You know the creature's exact location at all times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Conversion Domain</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Bring the lost sheep back to the fold, by persuasion or by power.\"</p>\n\n<p>Conversion Unionists are missionaries, preachers, and propagandists who spread the faith through both inspiring sermons and subtle manipulation. They convert the doubtful, minister to the faithful, and \"heal\" those suffering from heretical thoughts.</p>\n\n<h4>Conversion Domain Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unionist Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>charm person, sanctuary</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>calm emotions, suggestion</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>beacon of hope, tongues</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>aura of purity, charm monster</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>geas, modify memory</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Persuasion and Performance.</p>\n\n<h4>Compelling Presence</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, your faith makes you extraordinarily persuasive. You can add your Wisdom modifier to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Additionally, you learn the *friends* cantrip if you don't already know it.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Convert the Masses</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to sway hearts and minds. As an action, you present your holy symbol and deliver a sermon. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for 1 hour or until you or your allies do anything harmful to it. While charmed, the creature views Unionism favorably and is inclined to listen to your religious arguments.</p>\n\n<h4>Shepherd of Souls</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can tend to the spiritual wellbeing of your flock. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, that creature also gains temporary hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.</p>\n\n<h4>Divine Strike</h4>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<h4>Master Converter</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, your powers of conversion reach their apex. When you use your Convert the Masses Channel Divinity, creatures that fail their saving throw are permanently charmed unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each long rest. Additionally, you can cast *modify memory* once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>If your campaign uses the optional multiclassing rules, here's what you need to know if you choose Unionist as one of your classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Wisdom score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies Gained</h3>\n<p>If Unionist isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, and shields.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Unionist</h2>\n\n<h3>Faith and Power</h3>\n<p>As a Unionist, your magic comes from genuine faith in the Unnamed God\u2014but that faith is inseparable from belief in hierarchical order, state authority, and spiritual conformity. You may be a true believer who sees yourself as saving souls, or a cynical manipulator using religion as a tool of control. Either way, you represent divine power channeled through institutional authority.</p>\n\n<h3>Moral Complexity</h3>\n<p>Unionists can range from compassionate parish priests genuinely trying to help their communities to brutal inquisitors torturing <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> for confessions of \"soullessness.\" Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you truly believe the doctrine, or just use it for power?</li>\n<li>How do you reconcile faith with the church's cruelty?</li>\n<li>Have you ever doubted the Unnamed God's will?</li>\n<li>What happens when church orders conflict with mercy?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Unionist Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>Unionists often come from backgrounds like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/acolyte', 'Acolyte'); return false;\">Acolyte</a>, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/noble', 'Noble'); return false;\">Noble</a> (church nobility), <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/soldier', 'Soldier'); return false;\">Soldier</a> (military chaplain), or custom backgrounds like Inquisitor, Seminary Graduate, or Former Heretic.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Unionists as NPCs</h3>\n<p>Unionist NPCs make excellent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antagonists:</strong> Inquisitors hunting the party, corrupt bishops demanding bribes, zealots leading pogroms against <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a></li>\n<li><strong>Allies:</strong> Sympathetic priests hiding <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animals</a>, reformist clergy questioning doctrine, military chaplains in wartime</li>\n<li><strong>Complications:</strong> Authority figures the party must navigate, sources of healing with strings attached, witnesses who might report heresy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Divine Magic in Oz</h3>\n<p>The Unnamed God genuinely grants power to Unionists\u2014their magic works. This raises theological questions: Does divine power prove divine approval? Can an unjust god be truly divine? What if the Unnamed God is real, but evil? These questions can drive compelling storylines.</p>\n\n<h3>Power and Privilege</h3>\n<p>Unionists have significant social advantages in most of Oz. They can demand cooperation from officials, requisition supplies \"for church business,\" and expect deference from common folk. However, this also makes them targets in areas where Unionism is resented or where <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinite'); return false;\">Lurlinite</a> beliefs hold sway.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a> - The state religion</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'The Unnamed God'); return false;\">The Unnamed God</a> - The deity Unionists worship</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'The Lurlinite'); return false;\">The Lurlinite</a> - Religious rivals</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a> - Arcane counterpart</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> - Primary targets of persecution</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard of Oz'); return false;\">The Wizard of Oz</a> - Political authority Unionists serve</li>\n</ul>",

Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>You draw on the primal magic of nature and Lurline's ancient gift.</p>\n\n<h4>Cantrips</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Lurlinite spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column.</p>\n\n<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\n<p>The Lurlinite table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of your Lurlinite spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p>You prepare the list of Lurlinite spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Lurlinite spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Lurlinite spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Lurlinite level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Lurlinite spells, since your magic draws upon your attunement to nature and Lurline's blessing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p>You can cast a Lurlinite spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Lurlinite spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Circle</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you choose to identify with a sacred circle: Circle of the Green, Circle of the Moon, or Circle of Liberation. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Lurline's Gift</h3>\n<p>Also at 1st level, your connection to Lurline grants you the ability to speak with beasts and understand their responses. You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts. Additionally, <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> can always understand you, even if <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('conditions/magical/silenced', 'Silenced'); return false;\">Silenced</a> or otherwise unable to speak.</p>\n\n<h3>Wild Shape</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p>Your Lurlinite level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</p>\n\n<h4>Beast Shapes</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Level</th><th>Max CR</th><th>Limitations</th><th>Example</th></tr>\n<tr><td>2nd</td><td>1/4</td><td>No flying or swimming speed</td><td>Wolf</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4th</td><td>1/2</td><td>No flying speed</td><td>Crocodile</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8th</td><td>1</td><td>\u2014</td><td>Giant Eagle</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your Lurlinite level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<h3>Timeless Body</h3>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Additionally, you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically.</p>\n\n<h3>Beast Spells</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your Lurlinite spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a Lurlinite spell while in beast form, but you aren't able to provide material components.</p>\n\n<h3>Archdruid</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your Lurlinite spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>\n\n<h2>Sacred Circles</h2>\n\n<h3>Circle of the Green</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The land remembers what the church would have us forget.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Circle of the Green draws power from the living land of Oz itself\u2014the ancient forests of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a>, the wild steppes of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'the Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a>, even the gardens and parks within cities. They believe that the land itself is sacred, imbued with Lurline's original magic, and that protecting nature is protecting the source of all life and magic in Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Cantrip</h4>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 1st level, you learn one additional Lurlinite cantrip of your choice.</p>\n\n<h4>Natural Recovery</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Lurlinite level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Circle Spells</h4>\n<p>Your connection to the land grants you access to certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells.</p>\n\n<p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a circle spell that doesn't appear on the Lurlinite spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Lurlinite spell for you.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Lurlinite Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>barkskin, spider climb</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>call lightning, plant growth</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>divination, freedom of movement</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>commune with nature, tree stride</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Land's Sanctuary</h4>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you are in a natural environment, beasts and plant creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Additionally, you can move through nonmagical difficult terrain made of plants without expending extra movement and without taking damage from thorns, spines, and similar hazards.</p>\n\n<h4>Nature's Ward</h4>\n<p>When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n\n<h4>Nature's Sanctuary</h4>\n<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Lurlinite spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n\n<h3>Circle of the Moon</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"In the beast form, we find our truest selves.\"</p>\n\n<p>Circle of the Moon Lurlinites have a special kinship with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> and believe that the barrier between human and beast consciousness is artificial, imposed by the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist Church'); return false;\">Unionist Church</a> for political reasons. They can take animal forms more powerful than other Lurlinites, and many work directly with the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Combat Wild Shape</h4>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action. Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p>\n\n<h4>Circle Forms</h4>\n<p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).</p>\n\n<p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as your Lurlinite level divided by 3, rounded down.</p>\n\n<h4>Primal Strike</h4>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<h4>Elemental Wild Shape</h4>\n<p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.</p>\n\n<h4>Thousand Forms</h4>\n<p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast *alter self* at will.</p>\n\n<h3>Circle of Liberation</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Where there is oppression, Lurline calls us to resist.\"</p>\n\n<p>Circle of Liberation Lurlinites are activist-priests who see their faith as inseparable from the struggle for justice. They hide <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> from <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist'); return false;\">Unionist</a> inquisitors, smuggle the persecuted along the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-underground-railroad', 'Animal Underground Railroad'); return false;\">Animal Underground Railroad</a>, heal the wounded, and strike back against tyranny. This circle is unique to Oz's political situation.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.</p>\n\n<h4>Lurline's Shield</h4>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, your devotion to protecting the oppressed manifests as divine armor. While you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h4>Circle Spells</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>Lurlinite Level</th><th>Spells</th></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>aid, lesser restoration</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>beacon of hope, revivify</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>death ward, guardian of faith</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>mass cure wounds, raise dead</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn the Oppressor</h4>\n<p>At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words of condemnation. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist'); return false;\">Unionist</a>, government official, or creature serving an unjust authority within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n\n<h4>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h4>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Lurlinite level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>\n\n<h4>Liberation's Strike</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, when you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack or spell attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the start of your next turn.</p>\n\n<h4>Potent Spellcasting</h4>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Lurlinite cantrip.</p>\n\n<h4>Lurline's Wrath</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a> or other persecuted creature you can see within 60 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to that damage and deal radiant damage to the attacker equal to your Lurlinite level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>If your campaign uses the optional multiclassing rules, here's what you need to know if you choose Lurlinite as one of your classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Wisdom score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies Gained</h3>\n<p>If Lurlinite isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, and shields (Lurlinites will not wear metal armor or use metal shields).</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Lurlinite</h2>\n\n<h3>Faith in Hiding</h3>\n<p>As a Lurlinite, you practice a forbidden religion in a land where your faith is branded heresy. You gather in secret, use code words to identify fellow believers, and constantly risk discovery. Your prayers are whispered in hidden groves, your rituals performed by moonlight in the wilderness. You may outwardly pretend to be Unionist while maintaining your true faith in secret.</p>\n\n<h3>Resistance and Compassion</h3>\n<p>Lurlinites tend toward compassion for the oppressed and resistance against tyranny. Many are involved in underground movements helping <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> escape persecution. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How public are you about your faith? Do you hide it completely?</li>\n<li>What drew you to Lurlinism over the official Unionist church?</li>\n<li>How do you feel about <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionists'); return false;\">Unionists</a>? Are they all oppressors, or can some be redeemed?</li>\n<li>What would you sacrifice to protect an <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;\">Animal</a> from persecution?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Lurlinite Backgrounds</h3>\n<p>Lurlinites often come from backgrounds like Outlander, Folk Hero, Hermit, or custom backgrounds like Underground Railroad Conductor, Secret Cultist, or Animal Rights Activist.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Lurlinites as NPCs</h3>\n<p>Lurlinite NPCs make excellent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Allies:</strong> Healers for the party, guides in wilderness areas, contacts in the Animal resistance, sources of pre-Unionist lore</li>\n<li><strong>Quest Givers:</strong> Asking the party to rescue imprisoned Animals, destroy Unionist relics desecrating sacred sites, retrieve ancient Lurlinite artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Complications:</strong> Their association with the party might draw Unionist attention, they might ask the party to take dangerous stands against authority</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Lurlinite-Animal Connection</h3>\n<p>The close association between Lurlinites and the Animal Resistance creates natural story hooks. A Lurlinite PC might be asked to hide refugees, might discover an Animal community, or might be suspected of Animal sympathies by authorities.</p>\n\n<h3>Sacred Sites</h3>\n<p>Ancient Lurlinite sacred sites exist throughout Oz\u2014stone circles in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/the-vinkus', 'the Vinkus'); return false;\">the Vinkus</a>, hidden groves in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;\">Gillikin</a>, underwater shrines in <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/quadling-country', 'Quadling Country'); return false;\">Quadling lakes</a>.

Features</h2>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>Your innate magic or pact grants you the ability to cast spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Cantrips</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the Witch spell list. You learn additional Witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column.</p>\n\n<h4>Spell Slots</h4>\n<p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Witch spells of 1st through 9th level. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Witch spell list. The Spells Known column shows when you learn more Witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Witch spell list.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells, since the power of your magic relies on your force of will and personality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Witch spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch Path</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, choose the source of your witchcraft: the Path of Blood (innate power), Path of the Pact (bargained power), or Path of the Learned (studied power through texts like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'the Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>). Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch Sight</h3>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you can see magic as others see color. You can cast *detect magic* at will, without expending a spell slot. Additionally, when you see a creature casting a spell, you can use your reaction to identify the spell being cast (DC 15 + spell level Intelligence (Arcana) check).</p>\n\n<h3>Font of Magic</h3>\n<p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\n\n<h4>Sorcery Points</h4>\n<p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column (which equals your Witch level). You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Flexible Casting</h4>\n<p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating Spell Slots:</strong> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action. The created spell slot vanishes when you finish a long rest. See the Creating Spell Slots table.</li>\n<li><strong>Converting Spell Slots:</strong> As a bonus action, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Metamagic</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n\n<h4>Metamagic Options</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Careful Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</li>\n<li><strong>Distant Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Empowered Spell:</strong> When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Extended Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Heightened Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.</li>\n<li><strong>Quickened Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</li>\n<li><strong>Twinned Spell:</strong> When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n\n<h3>Broomflight</h3>\n<p>At 5th level, you learn to enchant a broom to serve as your flying mount. You can spend 10 minutes performing a ritual to bond with a broom. While riding your bonded broom, you have a flying speed of 50 feet. The broom has AC 15, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and you must bond with a new broom. You can have only one bonded broom at a time.</p>\n\n<h3>Witch Ascendant</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, your mastery of witchcraft reaches its apex. You regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no sorcery points remaining, you regain 4 sorcery points.</p>\n\n<h2>Witch Paths</h2>\n\n<h3>Path of Blood</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Magic runs in my veins. I was born this way.\"</p>\n\n<p>Witches of the Path of Blood are born with power coursing through them. Perhaps your mother was touched by wild magic during pregnancy, or your bloodline carries ancient fey heritage, or\u2014like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba'); return false;\">Elphaba</a>\u2014you emerged green-skinned and powerful from birth. Your magic is innate, instinctive, and often tied to strong emotion.</p>\n\n<h4>Born of Magic</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, your connection to magic manifests physically. Choose or roll on the Witch Mark table to determine your magical appearance. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Witch Mark (d6)</h4>\n<table>\n<tr><th>d6</th><th>Mark</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Green skin (like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba'); return false;\">Elphaba</a>)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Eyes that glow when casting spells</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>Hair that moves of its own accord</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>Shadow that doesn't match your movements</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5</td><td>Temperature changes around you with your emotions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6</td><td>Birthmark in the shape of an arcane symbol</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Empowered Magic</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you cast a Witch spell that deals damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.</p>\n\n<h4>Elemental Affinity</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.</p>\n\n<h4>Spell Resistance</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>\n\n<h4>Overwhelming Magic</h4>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, when you cast a spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>\n\n<h3>Path of the Pact</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I made a bargain. Power for a price.\"</p>\n\n<p>You gained your magic through a pact with a powerful entity\u2014perhaps a fey lord or lady, a devil offering temptation, the spirit of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/special-locations/deadly-desert', 'the Deadly Desert'); return false;\">the Deadly Desert</a>, or even <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/monsters/dragons/time-dragon', 'the Time Dragon'); return false;\">the Time Dragon</a> itself. You serve your patron's interests (willingly or not) in exchange for magical power.</p>\n\n<h4>Pact Magic</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn two eldritch invocations of your choice from the warlock class. When you gain certain Witch levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Eldritch Invocations Known table.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Witch Level</th><th>Invocations Known</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>3</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td></tr>\n<tr><td>14th</td><td>5</td></tr>\n<tr><td>18th</td><td>6</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Patron's Gift</h4>\n<p>Also at 1st level, choose the type of entity you made your pact with. Your choice grants you a specific benefit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fey Patron:</strong> You can cast *misty step* once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiend Patron:</strong> You gain resistance to fire damage and can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Great Old One Patron:</strong> You can telepathically communicate with any creature you can see within 30 feet. You don't need to share a language, but the creature must understand at least one language.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Pact Boon</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, your patron bestows a gift upon you. Choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Chain:</strong> You learn *find familiar* and can cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one special form: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</li>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Blade:</strong> You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You choose the form (any melee weapon). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical. The weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more or if you dismiss it (no action required).</li>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Tome:</strong> Your patron gives you a grimoire. Choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They are considered Witch spells for you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Patron's Blessing</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, your patron grants you a measure of their power. You can cast one 6th-level spell from your patron's spell list once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n\n<h4>Mystic Arcanum</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 7th-level spell from the Witch spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n\n<h4>Pact Master</h4>\n<p>At 18th level, you can petition your patron for aid. You can cast *wish* once. You must finish 30 days before you can do so again. When you use this feature, your patron always twists the wish in some way\u2014you get what you asked for, but there's always a price.</p>\n\n<h3>Path of the Learned</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I decoded the Grimmerie. I earned this power.\"</p>\n\n<p>You gained your magic through study of forbidden texts\u2014perhaps <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'the Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a> itself, or copies of its pages, or other dangerous magical writings. You are a scholar of the arcane, treating witchcraft as a science to be mastered rather than an innate gift or bargained power.</p>\n\n<h4>Spellbook</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level Witch spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the Witch spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n\n<h4>Preparing Spells</h4>\n<p>You prepare the list of Witch spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Witch spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Witch level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Learning Spells</h4>\n<p>Each time you gain a Witch level, you can add two Witch spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Additionally, when you find a wizard spell scroll or spellbook, you can add spells from it to your spellbook using the standard rules for learning wizard spells.</p>\n\n<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p>At 1st level, you can cast a Witch spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Arcane Recovery</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, you have learned to regain some magical energy through study. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your Witch level (rounded up), and none can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n\n<h4>Grimmerie Secrets</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, your study of forbidden texts has unlocked secret knowledge. Choose two spells from any class's spell list. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Witch table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as Witch spells for you and are added to your spellbook, but don't count against the number of spells you know.</p>\n\n<h4>Spell Mastery</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose two 1st-level or 2nd-level Witch spells that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared.</p>\n\n<h4>Signature Spell</h4>\n<p>At 18th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Witch spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>If your campaign uses the optional multiclassing rules, here's what you need to know if you choose Witch as one of your classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher (Intelligence 13 if Path of the Learned).</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies Gained</h3>\n<p>If Witch isn't your initial class, you gain no additional proficiencies.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Witch</h2>\n\n<h3>The Weight of the Name</h3>\n<p>In Oz, \"witch\" carries heavy connotations. <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/elphaba-thropp', 'Elphaba Thropp'); return false;\">Elphaba</a> became the Wicked Witch of the West\u2014but was she wicked, or was wickedness thrust upon her? Consider how your witch navigates this legacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you embrace the title \"witch\" or shy away from it?</li>\n<li>How do people react when they learn what you are?</li>\n<li>Are you fighting against Elphaba's dark reputation, or living up to it?</li>\n<li>What's your relationship with institutional magic users like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'Adepts'); return false;\">Adepts</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Moral Ambiguity</h3>\n<p>Witches in Oz exist in moral gray areas.

Finding it, reading it, protecting it, or destroying it can drive entire story arcs.</p>\n\n<h3>Persecution and Power</h3>\n<p>Witches are both feared and hunted. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist Church'); return false;\">Unionist Church</a> actively persecutes them.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Sneak Attack</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n\n<p>You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column.</p>\n\n<h3>Thieves' Cant</h3>\n<p>During your training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. It also includes a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages.</p>\n\n<h3>Cunning Action</h3>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n\n<h3>Agent Specialization</h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, you choose a specialization: Shadow Agent or Political Operative. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.</p>\n\n<h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</p>\n\n<h3>Evasion</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<h3>Reliable Talent</h3>\n<p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<h3>Blindsense</h3>\n<p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<h3>Slippery Mind</h3>\n<p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<h3>Elusive</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.</p>\n\n<h3>Stroke of Luck</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h2>Agent Specializations</h2>\n\n<h3>Shadow Agent</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I am the knife in the dark, the secret that dies with its keeper.\"</p>\n\n<p>Shadow Agents are assassins, infiltrators, and saboteurs. They excel at entering forbidden places, eliminating targets, and vanishing without a trace. Many work for <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'the Wizard\\'s'); return false;\">the Wizard's</a> secret police, while others serve resistance movements or operate as freelance killers.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>\n<p>When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.</p>\n\n<h4>Assassinate</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.</p>\n\n<h4>Infiltration Expertise</h4>\n<p>At 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. However, you can adopt the new identity as a disguise with the help of a disguise kit. Other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>\n\n<h4>Impostor</h4>\n<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.</p>\n\n<p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>\n\n<h4>Death Strike</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>\n\n<h3>Political Operative</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The pen is mightier than the sword\u2014but blackmail is mightiest of all.\"</p>\n\n<p>Political Operatives navigate the treacherous waters of Ozian politics, dealing in secrets, influence, and leverage. They might work for <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> officials, foreign powers, or themselves, always playing multiple sides against each other.</p>\n\n<h4>Master of Intrigue</h4>\n<p>When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land.</p>\n\n<h4>Master of Tactics</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</p>\n\n<h4>Insightful Manipulator</h4>\n<p>At 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The GM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intelligence score</li>\n<li>Wisdom score</li>\n<li>Charisma score</li>\n<li>Class levels (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the GM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.</p>\n\n<h4>Misdirection</h4>\n<p>Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.</p>\n\n<h4>Soul of Deceit</h4>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful, if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Dexterity score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<p>If Agent isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and one skill from the class's skill list, as well as thieves' tools.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying an Agent</h2>\n\n<h3>Loyalty and Betrayal</h3>\n<p>As an Agent, you live in a world of shifting allegiances. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who do you really serve? Is your public loyalty genuine or cover?</li>\n<li>Have you ever betrayed someone? Do you regret it?</li>\n<li>What lines won't you cross, even for your mission?</li>\n<li>How do you maintain your sense of self when constantly lying?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Weight of Secrets</h3>\n<p>Agents carry dangerous knowledge. In Oz's surveillance state, knowing the wrong thing can be fatal\u2014but so can not knowing enough.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Agents in Oz</h3>\n<p>Oz's police state creates perfect conditions for Agent campaigns. The <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'Wizard'); return false;\">Wizard</a> employs countless spies, while resistance movements need their own operatives. Every faction has Agents, and double agents are everywhere.</p>\n\n<h3>Information as Currency</h3>\n<p>In campaigns featuring Agents, treat information as valuable as gold. Secret documents, blackmail material, and surveillance reports can drive entire story arcs.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard'); return false;\">The Wizard</a> - The surveillance state</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/the-gale-force', 'The Gale Force'); return false;\">The Gale Force</a> - Resistance operatives</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> - Center of intrigue</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/animal-resistance', 'Animal Resistance'); return false;\">Animal Resistance</a> - Underground network</li>\n</ul>",

Your Academic die changes when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Academic Dice column.</p>\n\n<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.</p>\n\n<h3>Font of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Academic Support when you finish a short or long rest. The size of your Academic dice increases to d8 at 5th level, d10 at 10th level, and d12 at 15th level.</p>\n\n<h3>Expertise</h3>\n<p>At 10th level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n\n<h3>Superior Inspiration</h3>\n<p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Academic Support left, you regain one use.</p>\n\n<h2>Fields of Study</h2>\n\n<h3>Natural Philosophy</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Magic is a science waiting to be understood.\"</p>\n\n<p>Natural Philosophers study the fundamental laws governing magic, nature, and reality. They might research at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a>, analyze <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animal</a> consciousness, or attempt to decode <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'the Grimmerie'); return false;\">the Grimmerie</a>. Like <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a>, they seek objective truth\u2014which can be very dangerous in Oz.</p>\n\n<h4>Arcane Analysis</h4>\n<p>When you choose this field at 1st level, you learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these cantrips.</p>\n\n<h4>Scientific Method</h4>\n<p>Also at 1st level, when you make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Nature) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<h4>Cutting Words</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Academic Support, rolling an Academic die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.</p>\n\n<h4>Counterspell Expert</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can cast *counterspell* once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you use *counterspell* in this way, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the ability check.</p>\n\n<h4>Theorist's Insight</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration on their spell.</p>\n\n<h3>Historical Research</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Those who control the past control the future.\"</p>\n\n<p>Historical Researchers study Oz's past\u2014including the parts the government wants forgotten. They document the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/quadling-genocide', 'Quadling Genocide'); return false;\">Quadling Genocide</a>, preserve pre-Unionist traditions, and maintain the truth against official propaganda. This work is essential but perilous.</p>\n\n<h4>Historical Expertise</h4>\n<p>When you choose this field at 1st level, you gain proficiency in History. If you are already proficient in History, you gain expertise in it instead. Additionally, you learn to read, write, and speak two additional languages of your choice.</p>\n\n<h4>Keen Mind</h4>\n<p>Also at 1st level, you have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p>\n\n<h4>Tales of Inspiration</h4>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you use your Academic Support feature, you can speak of historical heroes and their deeds. The recipient of your Academic die gains temporary hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n\n<h4>Historian's Warning</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you can use your reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet is about to make a saving throw to grant them advantage on the roll, as you recall historical precedent for overcoming similar dangers. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Master Researcher</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when you spend at least 1 hour researching a topic in a library, archive, or similar repository of knowledge, you automatically learn any information that is recorded there about that topic, no roll required. Additionally, you can perfectly recall any text you have read in the past month.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher.</p>\n\n<p>If Scholar isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and two skills from the class's skill list.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Scholar</h2>\n\n<h3>Dangerous Knowledge</h3>\n<p>As a Scholar in Oz, you pursue knowledge that others fear. Consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What forbidden topic drives your research?</li>\n<li>Have you published under your own name or anonymously?</li>\n<li>What would you risk to preserve an important truth?</li>\n<li>How do you feel about state-controlled education?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Teacher or Researcher</h3>\n<p>Scholars might focus on teaching (inspiring others with knowledge) or pure research (discovering new truths). Both paths matter in Oz's fight for truth.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Scholars as Support</h3>\n<p>Scholars excel at supporting allies through Academic Support, making them valuable party members even without combat magic.</p>\n\n<h3>Research-Based Adventures</h3>\n<p>Scholar PCs create natural hooks for research-based quests: finding lost texts, interviewing survivors, accessing forbidden archives, or proving historical truths.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/shiz-university', 'Shiz University'); return false;\">Shiz University</a> - Center of learning</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/dr-dillamond', 'Dr. Dillamond'); return false;\">Dr. Dillamond</a> - Martyred scholar</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('objects/magic-items/artifacts/the-grimmerie', 'The Grimmerie'); return false;\">The Grimmerie</a> - Subject of study</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/quadling-genocide', 'Quadling Genocide'); return false;\">Quadling Genocide</a> - Suppressed history</li>\n</ul>",

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Satire</h3>\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"I speak truth to power\u2014and make them laugh while doing it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Satirical Performers use mockery, wit, and cutting words as weapons against tyranny and pretension.</p>\n\n<h4>Cutting Words</h4>\n<p>At 3rd level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of Performance Inspiration, rolling the die and subtracting the number from the creature's roll. You can use this after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it succeeds or fails.</p>\n\n<h4>Additional Magical Secrets</h4>\n<p>At 6th level, you learn two additional spells from any class. These count as Performer spells for you but don't count against your number of spells known.</p>\n\n<h4>Peerless Skill</h4>\n<p>At 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Performance Inspiration, rolling the die and adding it to your ability check. You can do this after seeing the roll but before knowing whether you succeed or fail.</p>\n\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher. If Performer isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor and one skill of your choice, plus one musical instrument of your choice.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Performer</h2>\n\n<h3>Art and Politics</h3>\n<p>As a Performer in Oz, consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you perform state-approved material or subversive art?</li>\n<li>Have you ever been censored? How did you respond?</li>\n<li>What message do you want your art to convey?</li>\n<li>Do you see yourself as entertainer or activist\u2014or both?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Performance and Propaganda</h3>\n<p>In Oz's authoritarian state, all public performance is political. State theaters spread propaganda, while underground shows spread resistance messages.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> - Theater district</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/the-wizard', 'The Wizard'); return false;\">The Wizard</a> - Censor-in-chief</li>\n</ul>",

They obey your commands and fight with the skill of ancient Quadling warriors. When the spell ends or a corpse drops to 0 hit points, the spirit departs peacefully.</p>\n\n<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>\n\n<p>Domingon magic is inseparable from Quadling culture. The tradition emphasizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> Many spells are more powerful when cast with multiple participants</li>\n<li><strong>Respect:</strong> Spirits must be approached with proper ritual and offerings</li>\n<li><strong>Memory:</strong> The dead are not gone; they remain accessible through trance and ritual</li>\n<li><strong>Liminality:</strong> Power comes from walking between worlds\u2014waking/dreaming, living/dead, material/spiritual</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Learning Domingon Magic</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;\">Grimmerie magic</a> which can be learned from books, Domingon magic requires personal instruction from a spirit-walker or participation in Quadling community rituals. Non-Quadlings who learn this tradition often do so through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extended time living in Quadling communities</li>\n<li>Marriage or adoption into Quadling families</li>\n<li>Being chosen by ancestral spirits in dreams</li>\n<li>Rescue or aid given to Quadling people, earning their trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Ritual Requirements</h3>\n<p>Many Domingon spells benefit from or require ritual casting. Consider requiring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drums, rattles, or other percussion instruments</li>\n<li>Ritual body paint or scarification</li>\n<li>Circle of participants (even if they're not spellcasters)</li>\n<li>Blood offerings (minor cuts, not life-threatening)</li>\n<li>Specific moon phases or times of day</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Spirit Interaction</h3>\n<p>Ancestral spirits in Domingon magic are not mere spell effects\u2014they're characters. Give them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distinct personalities based on their lives</li>\n<li>Opinions about current events and how the living honor the dead</li>\n<li>Willingness to help or refuse based on proper respect being shown</li>\n<li>Cultural knowledge from their era</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Political Context</h3>\n<p>In the Wizard's Oz, Domingon magic is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewed with suspicion by Emerald City authorities</li>\n<li>Tolerated in Quadling Country but monitored</li>\n<li>Sometimes confused with <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'Witch'); return false;\">Witchcraft</a> by ignorant officials</li>\n<li>A source of cultural resistance and Quadling identity</li>\n<li>Increasingly rare as younger Quadlings assimilate to Emerald City culture</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;\">Quadling</a> - The people who practice this tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a> - Can choose Domingon as their magical tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;\">Grimmerie Tradition</a> - Contrasting arcane tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">The Witch</a> - May learn Domingon magic through cultural exchange</li>\n</ul>\n",

The Animal is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions harm it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This is how most Animals come into being in Oz. It's extraordinarily controversial and considered heresy by the Unionist Church. Using this spell publicly will result in immediate persecution.</p>\n\n<h3>Memory of the Land (3rd Circle)</h3>\n<p><strong>School:</strong> Divination (ritual)<br>\n<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br>\n<strong>Range:</strong> Self<br>\n<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (dirt or plant matter from the location)<br>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>\n\n<p>You touch the ground and commune with the land itself, accessing its ancient memory.

The Hunt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obeys your telepathic commands</li>\n<li>Hunts down one target you designate (must have seen or have a piece of them)</li>\n<li>Can track prey unerringly within 10 miles</li>\n<li>Vanishes when the target is defeated or the spell ends</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> The Wild Hunt is terrifying and associated with the old, wild magic of Oz. Using this spell marks the caster as a powerful and dangerous Lurlinite.</p>\n\n<h3>Speak with Animal Consciousness (2nd Circle)</h3>\n<p><strong>School:</strong> Divination (ritual)<br>\n<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>\n<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br>\n<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>\n<strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <em>speak with animals</em>, this spell specifically allows you to communicate with conscious <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> telepathically, even if you don't share a language. For the duration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You and the Animal can communicate complex thoughts and emotions</li>\n<li>The Animal can share memories and experiences visually</li>\n<li>You gain advantage on Persuasion checks with the Animal</li>\n<li>The Animal can sense your intentions (you can't lie convincingly)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This spell is how Lurlinites coordinate with Animal resistance fighters without speaking aloud and risking detection.</p>\n\n<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>\n\n<p>Lurline magic is the spiritual heart of the Animal resistance movement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> Predates all other magical traditions in Oz</li>\n<li><strong>Natural:</strong> Flows from the land itself, not from books or institutions</li>\n<li><strong>Forbidden:</strong> Practicing Lurline magic openly is heresy in most of Oz</li>\n<li><strong>Communal:</strong> Often taught orally, practitioner to practitioner, in secret</li>\n<li><strong>Liberation:</strong> Many spells specifically help Animals and resist state oppression</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Learning Lurline Magic</h2>\n\n<p>Lurline magic cannot be learned from books or institutions. It requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct teaching from an existing Lurlinite</li>\n<li>Deep connection to natural Oz (spending months in wilderness)</li>\n<li>Acceptance by nature spirits or fey creatures</li>\n<li>Sometimes spontaneous awakening in times of great need (especially for Animals)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> have an instinctive connection to Lurline magic and can learn it more easily than humanoids.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Power and Persecution</h3>\n<p>Lurlinites walk a dangerous path in the Wizard's Oz:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Their magic is illegal in most regions</li>\n<li>They're hunted by <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'Unionist'); return false;\">Unionist Inquisitors</a></li>\n<li>They're heroes to the Animal resistance</li>\n<li>Their spells directly counter Unionist control magic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Environmental Connection</h3>\n<p>Consider requiring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Urban Penalty:</strong> Lurline spells might require higher-level spell slots in cities</li>\n<li><strong>Corrupted Land:</strong> Areas scarred by industrialization might block Lurline magic entirely</li>\n<li><strong>Sacred Sites:</strong> Ancient groves and Lurline shrines might grant bonus effects</li>\n<li><strong>The Green:</strong> Lurline magic is strongest in the Great Gillikin Forest and other wild places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Lurline Herself</h3>\n<p>Is Lurline a god, a fairy queen, or simply a mythologized magical force? Different Lurlinites have different beliefs. Unlike the Unnamed God, Lurline doesn't grant explicit divine intervention\u2014her power flows more subtly through nature itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'The Lurlinite'); return false;\">The Lurlinite</a> - Primary class using this tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/lurline', 'Lurline'); return false;\">Lurline</a> - The fairy queen who blessed Oz</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animals'); return false;\">Animals</a> - Often instinctively connected to Lurline magic</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/unionist-tradition', 'Unionist Tradition'); return false;\">Unionist Tradition</a> - Rival divine tradition</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;\">The Witch</a> - Some witches learn Lurline magic</li>\n</ul>\n",

Built in the Gillikinese architectural style of a century past, it appears abandoned but is, in fact, very much alive. The house is bound to <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> through decades of ritual magic, making it an extension of her will\u2014and potentially her final trap.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The House is Watching:</strong> Yackle can perceive anything that happens in any room</li>\n<li><strong>Doors Lock and Unlock:</strong> Yackle controls movement through the house</li>\n<li><strong>Objects Animate:</strong> Furniture, portraits, and decorations can become threats</li>\n<li><strong>Time Feels Wrong:</strong> Clocks show different times, shadows move incorrectly</li>\n<li><strong>Memory is Stored Here:</strong> The house contains fragments of lives Yackle has absorbed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Exterior and Approach</h2>\n\n<h3>First Impressions</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe carriage climbs the final switchback into the Pertha Hills as twilight settles. Through bare trees, you glimpse your destination: a gray stone manor, three stories tall, with narrow windows like suspicious eyes. No smoke rises from the chimneys. No lights burn in the windows. The grounds are overgrown\u2014roses gone wild, fountains dry and cracked. As your carriage stops before the front door, you notice the absolute silence. No birds. No wind. Just the house, waiting.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>The Grounds</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overgrown Gardens:</strong> Once formal, now wild. Roses still bloom despite the season.</li>\n<li><strong>Dry Fountain:</strong> Central courtyard. Carved with scenes of harvests and hunts. Basin is cracked.</li>\n<li><strong>Carriage House:</strong> Empty except for one ancient coach with rotting wheels.</li>\n<li><strong>Servant Quarters:</strong> Small building, separate from main house. Abandoned decades ago.</li>\n<li><strong>The Well:</strong> Behind the house. Very deep. Echoes strangely. (Secret: connects to basement)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Front Door</h3>\n<p>Heavy oak, iron-banded, with a brass knocker shaped like a sleeping face. The door is unlocked\u2014but once all heirs are inside, it will not open again until Yackle permits it.</p>\n\n<h2>Ground Floor</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Foyer</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe front door opens to a two-story foyer lit by a single chandelier of dusty crystal. A grand staircase curves upward. The floor is black and white marble, laid in a spiral pattern that makes your eyes swim if you look too long. Doors lead left and right. Ahead, through an archway, you glimpse a dining room. The air smells of old paper and something floral\u2014roses, maybe, or funeral lilies.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chandelier:</strong> Can fall (Yackle's doing) - Dex save DC 15 or 4d6 bludgeoning damage</li>\n<li><strong>Spiral Floor:</strong> Staring at it: Wisdom save DC 13 or become briefly disoriented (disadvantage on next check)</li>\n<li><strong>Portrait:</strong> Above the stairs. Woman in old-fashioned dress. Eyes seem to follow movement. (This is Yackle as she appeared decades ago)</li>\n<li><strong>Side Tables:</strong> Vase with dried roses. Guest book (last entry: 47 years ago).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Secret:</strong> The spiral pattern on the floor matches the ritual circle in the hidden basement. Investigation DC 18 to notice this if you've seen both.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Parlor (West Wing, Ground Floor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThis parlor was once elegant\u2014now it's a museum of decay. Velvet furniture faded to gray. A cold fireplace. Bookshelves with volumes whose spines have crumbled away. A grandfather clock stands in the corner, its hands frozen at seven minutes past midnight.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Clock:</strong> Stopped at 12:07. If wound, it chimes\u2014and time throughout the house begins moving strangely. (See Lair Actions)</li>\n<li><strong>Books:</strong> Philosophy, theology, forbidden histories. Investigation DC 14: find a volume on Kumbric Witch mythology.</li>\n<li><strong>Furniture:</strong> Can animate if Yackle wishes. Armchair (CR 1/2), loveseat (CR 1).</li>\n<li><strong>Hidden Compartment:</strong> Behind false book spine. Contains Yackle's diary from 40 years ago. Reveals she was searching for \"a way to become what She was.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>3. Dining Room (Central, Ground Floor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe dining table is set for seven. Crystal goblets, silver cutlery, fine china\u2014all covered in decades of dust. Seven high-backed chairs wait. At the head of the table sits an eighth chair, notably larger, carved with thorned roses. A bell sits beside that place setting.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Bell:</strong> Silver, engraved with Yackle's name. If rung, Yackle's voice echoes through the house: \"I'm so glad you've come.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Place Settings:</strong> Each has a name card. Six match the heirs. The seventh says \"The Witness\" (Mr. Trism). The eighth says \"The Hostess.\"</li>\n<li><strong>The Meal:</strong> If the bell is rung, spectral servants (Memory Shades) appear and begin serving a phantom feast. The food looks real but tastes of ash and old flowers.</li>\n<li><strong>Chandelier Above:</strong> Heavy, ornate. Can be dropped as attack (Dex save DC 15, 6d6 damage).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Secret:</strong> Under \"The Hostess\" plate is a key. It opens the locked door to the Observatory (third floor).</p>\n\n<h3>4. Kitchen (East Wing, Ground Floor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe kitchen is surprisingly clean\u2014almost as if someone still uses it. A cast-iron stove, cold now. A prep table with knives hanging above. Copper pots gleaming faintly. A pantry door stands ajar, darkness beyond.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Stove:</strong> If investigated closely, the ash in the firebox is still slightly warm. (Yackle was here recently.)</li>\n<li><strong>Knives:</strong> Can animate as flying weapons if Yackle chooses. Attack +5, 1d4+2 piercing, 30 ft range.</li>\n<li><strong>Pantry:</strong> Mostly empty. One shelf has fresh bread, clearly magical. (Eating it: Con save DC 14 or fall into a trance-like sleep for 1 hour.)</li>\n<li><strong>Servant's Stairs:</strong> Narrow staircase leads to second floor servants' quarters.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Clue:</strong> Perception DC 15: There's a very faint scent of green-tinged skin here. Not perfume. Something else. (Yackle's scent.)</p>\n\n<h3>5. Library (West Wing, Ground Floor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nFloor-to-ceiling bookshelves crowd this room. A rolling ladder, a reading desk, a leather chair by a window. Most books are moldering, but some appear well-maintained. The air here is thick with old paper and something acrid\u2014ink, maybe, or old magic.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Collection:</strong> Arcana DC 12 reveals many forbidden texts. Topics: pre-Lurline magic, soul transference, immortality, the Kumbric Witch.</li>\n<li><strong>Reading Desk:</strong> Open book: \"The Hunger That Outlasts Death.\" Underlined passage: \"To become eternal, one must consume that which makes others alive\u2014their memories, their loves, their grief.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Ritual Circle:</strong> Hidden under the rug. Investigation DC 16. Chalk and dried blood, forming a 7-pointed star.</li>\n<li><strong>Trapped Book:</strong> One volume (spine reads \"The Grimmerie's Origins\") is trapped. Touching it: Wisdom save DC 15 or take 3d6 psychic damage and see a flash of Yackle's face, much younger, screaming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Major Clue:</strong> Book titled \"Vessels and Vicars: On Bodily Transference\" describes how a dying witch can prepare a ritual to transfer her consciousness into a new body\u2014specifically, into someone who has been marked with her power.</p>\n\n<h2>Second Floor</h2>\n\n<h3>6. Master Bedroom (East Wing, Second Floor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThis was clearly the mistress's chamber. A four-poster bed with moth-eaten curtains. A vanity with a cracked mirror. A wardrobe standing open, revealing old dresses in styles from decades past. The window overlooks the wild gardens. Everything is perfectly preserved\u2014too perfectly. No dust here.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Mirror:</strong> Cracks form a pattern like a spider's web. Looking into it: Charisma save DC 14 or see your reflection smile when you don't.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wardrobe:</strong> Dresses in green, gray, black. One dress is newer\u2014recently made. It's sized for one of the heirs. (Yackle's prepared it for her new body.)</li>\n<li><strong>Under the Bed:</strong> A lockbox. Lock DC 15. Contains letters between Yackle and someone signed only \"K.W.\" (Kumbric Witch). The last letter: \"You will inherit what I was, but the price is all that you are.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Secret Panel:</strong> Investigation DC 17. Behind the headboard. Contains Yackle's true will\u2014the real one, not the fake Trism read. It names no heirs. It says: \"I leave myself to the one who can endure me.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>7. Guest Bedrooms (West Wing, Second Floor)</h3>\n<p>Six bedrooms, nearly identical. Each has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A narrow bed</li>\n<li>A small writing desk</li>\n<li>A window (locked from outside)</li>\n<li>A name card on the door matching each heir</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Trick:</strong> These rooms are designed to isolate heirs. If someone sleeps in one, they experience vivid nightmares drawn from Yackle's memories of previous \"guests.\" Wisdom save DC 14 or wake with one level of exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personalization:</strong> Each room has been subtly customized for its designated heir:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Scholar's room: Books on their exact research topic</li>\n<li>The Heir's room: Family portraits they've never seen</li>\n<li>The Animal's room: Subtle pro-Animal pamphlets (a test?)</li>\n<li>The Debtor's room: Account books showing their exact debts</li>\n<li>The Maunt's room: Religious texts from their former order</li>\n<li>The Widow's room: Personal effects of their lost loved one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>This proves Yackle has been watching them for a long time.</em></p>\n\n<h3>8. Portrait Gallery (Central Hall, Second Floor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe upstairs hallway is lined with portraits. Dozens of faces stare out from ornate frames\u2014men and women in styles spanning a century. Some you recognize from Oz history. Others are unknown. But they all share one thing: a certain emptiness in their eyes, as if something vital has been taken from them.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Portraits:</strong> History DC 14 reveals some are of people who vanished mysteriously over the past 50 years. All were guests of Yackle.</li>\n<li><strong>The Newest Portrait:</strong> Still has wet paint. It shows one of the heirs\u2014perfectly rendered, as if from life. (Yackle painted it. She's choosing.)</li>\n<li><strong>Animate Portraits:</strong> During combat, Yackle can make 1d4 portraits attack. They slide out of frames as Shadow Selves (use the stat block from House Horrors).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Secret:</strong> One portrait has a false back. Investigation DC 16. Behind it: a spy hole looking into the Master Bedroom.</p>\n\n<h3>9. Servants' Quarters (East Wing, Second Floor)</h3>\n<p>Small, cramped rooms. Long abandoned. Beds with rotted linens. Nothing of value\u2014except one room where:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Last Servant's Room:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A journal on the bedside table</li>\n<li>Last entry: \"She doesn't age. I've been here 30 years and she doesn't age. I'm leaving tonight.\"</li>\n<li>The servant never left. Their skeleton is in the closet, locked from the outside.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Third Floor</h2>\n\n<h3>10. The Observatory (Locked)</h3>\n<p><strong>Key required:</strong> Under the plate in the dining room, or Thieves' Tools DC 18.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe top floor is a single round room beneath a glass dome. Telescopes point at the sky. Star charts cover the walls. At the center: a massive orrery of Oz's moons, slowly rotating despite no visible mechanism. The air here hums with magic.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Orrery:</strong> Made of brass and crystal. Arcana DC 15: It's not showing the current sky\u2014it's showing the sky 50 years ago, the night Yackle performed her first ritual.</li>\n<li><strong>Star Charts:</strong> Covered in Yackle's notes. \"The alignment is near.\" \"She promised I would not die.\" \"The vessel must arrive willingly.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Ritual Components:</strong> Chalk, candles, dried herbs, a silver knife. Everything needed for a transference ritual.</li>\n<li><strong>The View:</strong> From here, you can see for miles\u2014and you can see that the roads leading to the estate have vanished. You're cut off.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Major Clue:</strong> A prepared ritual circle is drawn on the floor. Seven points. Six for \"contributors\" (the other heirs). One for \"the inheritor\" (Yackle's new body). In the center: a space for \"the willing heart\" (the true sacrifice).</p>\n\n<h3>11. Yackle's Study (Hidden)</h3>\n<p><strong>Access:</strong> Secret door from Observatory. Investigation DC 18, or Yackle reveals it during confrontation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThis room is small, windowless, and absolutely crammed with magical apparatus. Jars of pickled things. Bottles of luminous liquids. A desk covered in notes in a cramped, frantic hand. And on the wall: a mirror, but the reflection it shows is not this room. It shows a chamber deep underground, lit by green witchfire.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Mirror:</strong> It's a window to the Heart Chamber (basement). Touching it: transported there instantly (no save, Yackle's trap).</li>\n<li><strong>The Notes:</strong> Yackle's research. \"I have outlived three bodies. The fourth is prepared. The fifth will be eternal.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Preservation Jars:</strong> Each contains a piece of someone: a finger, an eye, a tongue. Labels name previous \"heirs\" who failed.</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Diary (Final Volume):</strong> Last entry: \"Tonight. The alignment is perfect. One will provide the vessel. The rest will provide the fuel. And I will finally become what She promised\u2014deathless, complete, a witch without limits.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Basement (The Heart Chamber)</h2>\n\n<h3>Access</h3>\n<p>Three ways down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Well:</strong> Outside. Climb down 60 feet. Athletics DC 13.</li>\n<li><strong>Servant Stairs Secret:</strong> From kitchen, Investigation DC 17 reveals hidden staircase.</li>\n<li><strong>The Mirror:</strong> From Yackle's Study. Instant but one-way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>12. The Heart Chamber</h3>\n<p><strong>Read-aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nYou descend into the earth. The air grows cold. The walls are raw stone, carved with symbols in a language that predates Lurline. At the bottom: a circular chamber, lit by sickly green witchfire that burns without heat. In the center, a ritual circle identical to the one in the Observatory\u2014but this one pulses with power. You can feel it in your teeth, your bones. This is the true heart of the house. And standing in the circle, waiting, is Yackle herself.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Circle:</strong> Seven points, glowing. Each point has a name carved into the floor\u2014the six heirs plus \"The Inheritor.\"</li>\n<li><strong>The Walls:</strong> Covered in Kumbric script. Religion DC 18 or Arcana DC 16: These are binding spells, keeping the house anchored to this plane.</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Altar:</strong> A stone slab with manacles. Bloodstains. This is where she performs the final ritual.</li>\n<li><strong>The Fuel:</strong> Along the walls, alcoves contain the desiccated remains of previous victims\u2014people whose memories and life force were consumed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>This is where the final confrontation happens.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>The House as a Character</h2>\n\n<h3>House Behavior by Stage</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 1 - The Reading (Welcoming):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doors open easily</li>\n<li>Lights flicker on in occupied rooms</li>\n<li>Subtle creaks and settlings, but nothing overtly hostile</li>\n<li>The house \"herds\" the heirs toward the dining room</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 2 - Exploration (Watching):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doors sometimes lock behind the players</li>\n<li>Portraits' eyes follow movement</li>\n<li>Clocks chime at wrong times</li>\n<li>Players hear whispers (echoes of previous victims)</li>\n<li>The house separates players who split up</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 3 - Tests/Hunting (Aggressive):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Furniture animates and attacks</li>\n<li>Doors seal shut, trapping players</li>\n<li>Shadows move independently</li>\n<li>Temperature drops; breath visible</li>\n<li>The house actively hunts the players, using lair actions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 4 - Confrontation (Desperate):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The house merges with Yackle\u2014they are one entity</li>\n<li>Walls bleed</li>\n<li>Geometry becomes non-Euclidean</li>\n<li>The house tries to collapse on the players if Yackle is near death</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Lair Actions</h3>\n<p>On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the house takes one lair action:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sealing Doors:</strong> All doors in a 30-foot radius around a target lock. DC 18 Strength to force open, or they unlock at the end of the round.</li>\n<li><strong>Animated Assault:</strong> 1d4 pieces of furniture animate and attack the nearest creature. Use Animated Armor stats but reskin as chairs, tables, suits of armor.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Distortion:</strong> One creature must make a Wisdom save DC 16 or repeat their last action exactly (including movement and targets if possible). If impossible, they lose their action.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Flash:</strong> All creatures in one room must make a Wisdom save DC 15 or be stunned until the end of their next turn as they experience a fragment of a previous victim's final moments.</li>\n<li><strong>Structural Shift:</strong> The house rearranges. A doorway that led to the parlor now leads to a bedroom. Players must make new mental maps. (This can only happen once per confrontation.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>GM Notes: Using the Estate</h2>\n\n<h3>Pacing the Reveal</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early (Stage 1-2):</strong> The house seems merely old and creepy. Foreshadow with small details: warm ash, wrong reflections, portraits watching.</li>\n<li><strong>Middle (Stage 3):</strong> Escalate to overt threats. Animated furniture, locked doors, whispers. Make it clear the house itself is hostile.</li>\n<li><strong>Late (Stage 4):</strong> Full horror. The house is Yackle's body. Defeating her means destroying the house\u2014and escaping before it collapses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Player Agency</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Let players explore freely in Stage 2. Don't force them into a railroad.</li>\n<li>Reward investigation. Every clue brings them closer to understanding Yackle's plan.</li>\n<li>If they try to leave early, the doors are sealed\u2014but they can break windows, climb down, flee through the gardens. Yackle will hunt them, but escape is possible (though it ends the adventure prematurely).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Witch Player's Advantage</h3>\n<p>The player secretly playing Yackle's vessel knows the house layout instinctively. Give them subtle hints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"You feel drawn to the library.\"</li>\n<li>\"You know, somehow, that there's a hidden door here.\"</li>\n<li>\"The house wants you to find the observatory.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This makes them feel special without giving away the secret immediately.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> - The mistress of the estate</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake</a> - Full adventure</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/house-horrors', 'House Horrors'); return false;\">House Horrors</a> - Creatures that inhabit the estate</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/pertha-hills', 'Pertha Hills'); return false;\">Pertha Hills</a> - Regional context</li>\n</ul>\n",

What I will be next depends on you, dear heirs.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle is not merely the villain of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake</a>\u2014she is a cosmic tragedy. An ancient being who existed before Lurline spoke the Eight Words that gave Oz structure, Yackle is trapped by the Binding of Witness: she exists because she is unseen, but cannot truly live or die. For over a thousand years, she has been suspended in this liminal state, desperately seeking either true existence or final dissolution.</p>\n\n<h3>The Truth About Yackle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> Over 1,000 years old. She remembers the Kumbric Void before creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Origin:</strong> A fragment of pre-Lurline chaos given consciousness by Lurline's first Word: REMEMBER. She was never meant to be.</li>\n<li><strong>Current State:</strong> Neither alive nor dead. The Binding of Witness keeps her in stasis\u2014unseen, unwitnessed, unable to truly exist.</li>\n<li><strong>The House:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate</a> is an extension of her being, sustaining her and trapping her simultaneously.</li>\n<li><strong>The Heirs:</strong> Not heirs\u2014they are inversions of the Eight Bindings. By witnessing their truths, Yackle hopes to break the eighth Binding and achieve dissolution (or ascension, if she collects all eight secrets).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Personality & Roleplaying</h2>\n\n<h3>As Madame Viridian (Disguise)</h3>\n<p>Yackle plays the role of \"Madame Viridian,\" a widow and fellow heir. She is a consummate actor, having practiced deception for centuries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Observes more than she speaks</li>\n<li>Occasionally knows things she shouldn't (then covers with excuses)</li>\n<li>Shows subtle contempt for the \"greedy\" heirs</li>\n<li>Seems to know her way around the house</li>\n<li>Touches objects with odd familiarity</li>\n<li>Asks probing questions about each heir's past</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Measured, calm, with occasional slips into archaic phrasing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tells (Foreshadowing):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never eats or drinks (claims fasting, nerves, etc.)</li>\n<li>Casts no reflection in certain mirrors</li>\n<li>Animals (if any) react with fear to her presence</li>\n<li>She doesn't bleed if cut\u2014or bleeds something greenish</li>\n<li>Knows the names of servants who died centuries ago</li>\n<li>The house responds to her emotions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>When Revealed</h3>\n<p>Once her cover is blown (or she chooses to reveal herself), Yackle drops all pretense.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personality Revealed:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lonely:</strong> A millennium of isolation has left her desperately craving connection, even as she prepares to consume the heirs</li>\n<li><strong>Philosophical:</strong> Views existence and non-existence as the only moral questions that matter</li>\n<li><strong>Tired:</strong> Exhausted by a thousand years of unchanging existence</li>\n<li><strong>Desperate:</strong> Will do anything to either truly exist or finally end</li>\n<li><strong>Conflicted:</strong> Genuinely likes some of the heirs, which makes what she must do harder</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Sample Dialogue:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"Do you know what it's like to exist for a thousand years without ever truly being <em>seen</em>? To watch everyone you've ever known die, again and again, while you remain? I don't want your lives. I want what you have that I never did\u2014the chance to be real.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The Bindings made me. Memory, the first Word, gave me consciousness. But Witness, the eighth Word\u2014that one trapped me. I exist only because I am unseen. To be witnessed is to break. I've been waiting a millennium for someone brave enough to truly see me.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Goals & Motivations</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Collect Inversions:</strong> Each heir represents an inversion of one of the Eight Bindings. By collecting their secrets (witnessing their truths), Yackle weakens the Bindings.</li>\n<li><strong>Break the Eighth Binding:</strong> When the heirs witness her true form in the Heart Chamber, the Binding of Witness cracks. This is what she's been engineering for centuries.</li>\n<li><strong>Achieve Dissolution (or Ascension):</strong>\n   <ul>\n   <li>If fewer than 8 secrets: She hopes to finally die, to dissolve into peaceful non-existence.</li>\n   <li>If all 8 secrets: She transforms into something beyond Binding\u2014truly immortal, truly powerful (Phase 4).</li>\n   </ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What She Wants From Each Heir</h3>\n<p>Each heir embodies an inversion of a Binding. When they reveal their secret in Yackle's presence, she collects that inversion's power:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Averic (Memory):</strong> Rewrote the past - False memories weaken truth</li>\n<li><strong>Liir (Blood):</strong> Claims false lineage - Severed connection weakens heritage</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick (Nature):</strong> Denies true self - Hidden identity weakens essence</li>\n<li><strong>Shell (Service):</strong> Punished for service - Betrayed loyalty weakens devotion</li>\n<li><strong>Sarima (Sacrifice):</strong> Traded instead of gave - Bargained exchange weakens gift</li>\n<li><strong>Mareth (Deed):</strong> Unchanged by actions - Unpunished atrocity weakens transformation</li>\n<li><strong>Seven (Hunger):</strong> Hungers but shouldn't - Mechanical longing weakens natural desire</li>\n<li><strong>The Eighth (Witness):</strong> Never truly seen - When the heirs witness Yackle's true form, the final Binding breaks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>\n\n<h3>Phase 1: The Revealed Witch (CR 11)</h3>\n<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> Yackle's disguise is broken, or she chooses to reveal herself. She fights as a powerful arcane caster, using the house as her lair.</p>\n\n<div class=\"stat-block\" style=\"border: 2px solid #8B4513; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #FFF8DC;\">\n<h4>Yackle (Phase 1)</h4>\n<p><em>Medium humanoid (primordial), neutral evil</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 15 (mage armor)<br>\n<strong>Hit Points</strong> 200 (20d8 + 100)<br>\n<strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.</p>\n\n<table style=\"width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 8px 0;\">\n<tr>\n<th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 (+0)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>20 (+5)</td><td>20 (+5)</td><td>18 (+4)</td><td>16 (+3)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong> Int +9, Wis +8<br>\n<strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +13, Deception +11, History +13, Insight +8, Perception +8<br>\n<strong>Damage Resistances</strong> necrotic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks<br>\n<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, frightened<br>\n<strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 18<br>\n<strong>Languages</strong> Common, Kumbric (ancient dialect), Ozian dialects, telepathy 60 ft.<br>\n<strong>Challenge</strong> 11 (7,200 XP)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong> If Yackle fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong> Yackle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Collected Secrets.</strong> For each secret Yackle has collected (see Secret Collection below), she gains specific combat benefits. Mark which secrets have been revealed in her presence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> Yackle is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li><strong>Cantrips (at will):</strong> <em>mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp</em></li>\n<li><strong>1st level (4 slots):</strong> <em>detect magic, mage armor, magic missile, shield</em></li>\n<li><strong>2nd level (3 slots):</strong> <em>hold person, misty step, suggestion</em></li>\n<li><strong>3rd level (3 slots):</strong> <em>counterspell, dispel magic, fear, fireball</em></li>\n<li><strong>4th level (3 slots):</strong> <em>dimension door, greater invisibility, polymorph</em></li>\n<li><strong>5th level (3 slots):</strong> <em>dominate person, hold monster, telekinesis</em></li>\n<li><strong>6th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>chain lightning, true seeing</em></li>\n<li><strong>7th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>finger of death</em></li>\n<li><strong>8th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>feeblemind</em></li>\n<li><strong>9th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>time stop</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes two attacks with Void Touch or casts a cantrip and makes one Void Touch attack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Void Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (3d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kumbric Extraction (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Yackle targets one creature within 60 feet that has not yet revealed their secret. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and is compelled to speak their deepest secret aloud. Yackle immediately collects that secret's power. On a success, the target takes half damage and resists the extraction. Characters who have already revealed their secrets voluntarily are immune to this ability.</p>\n\n<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>\n\n<p>Yackle can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Yackle regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cantrip.</strong> Yackle casts a cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Move.</strong> Yackle moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Yackle casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Memory Drain (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> Yackle targets one creature she can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage and become stunned until the end of its next turn as Yackle tears a memory from its mind. Yackle regains hit points equal to half the psychic damage dealt.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3>Secret Collection Benefits</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects a secret (either through Kumbric Extraction or by being present when it's revealed), she gains the following benefits during Phase 1:</p>\n\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 16px 0;\">\n<tr style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\">\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Character</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Secret Collected Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\"><strong>Averic</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Averic has disadvantage on Intelligence saves.

Yackle merges fully with the house, becoming a distributed consciousness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Change in Tactics:</strong> Yackle is now everywhere and nowhere.

If forced outside (via <em>banishment</em>, etc.), she can manifest a spectral form but has disadvantage on all rolls until she returns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Distributed Existence.</strong> Yackle does not have a single body. Damage must be dealt to the house itself (attacking structural elements, destroying ritual anchors, etc.). Destroying a manifestation does not harm her directly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regeneration.</strong> The house regains 20 hit points at the start of Yackle's turn if she has at least 1 hit point.</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The house makes three attacks: any combination of Manifested Strike, Structural Assault, or casts a spell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Manifested Strike.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. (Yackle manifests a spectral limb from a wall, floor, or ceiling to strike.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structural Assault.</strong> Yackle causes part of the house to attack. Choose one:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Falling Debris:</strong> Targets in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage (half on success).</li>\n<li><strong>Animated Furniture:</strong> 1d4 objects (chairs, tables, suits of armor) animate and attack as if using the <em>animate objects</em> spell (Yackle's spell save DC).</li>\n<li><strong>Sealing Room:</strong> All doors and windows in one room seal shut. DC 20 Strength check to force open, or they remain closed until the end of the round.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> Yackle retains her spellcasting ability from Phase 1. However, she now casts spells from any point in the house (walls, floors, ceilings, mirrors, etc.).</p>\n\n<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>\n\n<p>The house can take 3 legendary actions (same options as Phase 1, plus):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shift Geometry (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The house rearranges itself. Doorways lead to different rooms. Staircases reverse direction. Players must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or become lost (disadvantage on navigation checks for 1 minute).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Invoke Terror (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> All creatures in one room must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use their movement to flee toward the nearest exit. They can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.</p>\n\n<h4>Lair Actions</h4>\n\n<p>On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the house takes a lair action. Roll 1d6:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sealing Doors:</strong> All doors within 60 feet of a chosen point lock. DC 18 Strength to force.</li>\n<li><strong>Animated Assault:</strong> 2d4 objects animate and attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Distortion:</strong> One creature repeats its last action (Wisdom save DC 17 negates).</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Flash:</strong> All creatures in one room are stunned until the end of their next turn (Wisdom save DC 17 negates).</li>\n<li><strong>Structural Collapse:</strong> Ceiling collapses in a 20-foot cube. Dexterity save DC 17 or take 4d10 bludgeoning damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Whispers of the Dead:</strong> All creatures in the house hear the voices of Yackle's previous victims. Wisdom save DC 17 or take 3d8 psychic damage and become frightened of Yackle for 1 minute.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3>How to Defeat Phase 2</h3>\n<p>Yackle cannot be killed through normal damage in this phase. Players must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find the Heart Chamber:</strong> Located in the cellar, accessed through the false wall (map found in puzzle box).</li>\n<li><strong>Reach Yackle's True Body:</strong> Suspended in the Heart Chamber by shadow threads connected to three anchor points.</li>\n<li><strong>Proceed to Phase 3:</strong> Once players reach the Heart Chamber and witness Yackle's true form, the Binding of Witness cracks and Phase 3 begins.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Phase 3: The Heart Chamber (CR 9)</h3>\n<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> The players reach the Heart Chamber and witness Yackle's true body. The eighth Binding\u2014Witness\u2014cracks. She manifests in her original form\u2014ancient, withered, real for the first time in a millennium.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visual Description:</strong> Yackle's original body, suspended by shadow threads in the center of the circular room. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. As the players enter, her eyes open\u2014genuinely seeing and being seen for the first time in a thousand years.</p>\n\n<div class=\"stat-block\" style=\"border: 2px solid #8B4513; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #FFF8DC;\">\n<h4>Yackle's True Form (Phase 3)</h4>\n<p><em>Medium aberration (primordial entity), neutral evil</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 (natural armor)<br>\n<strong>Hit Points</strong> 150 (20d8 + 60)<br>\n<strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.</p>\n\n<table style=\"width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 8px 0;\">\n<tr>\n<th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 (+0)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>16 (+3)</td><td>20 (+5)</td><td>18 (+4)</td><td>16 (+3)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong> Int +9, Wis +8, Cha +7<br>\n<strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +13, History +13, Insight +8<br>\n<strong>Damage Vulnerabilities</strong> radiant<br>\n<strong>Damage Resistances</strong> necrotic, psychic<br>\n<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> frightened<br>\n<strong>Senses</strong> truesight 60 ft., passive Perception 14<br>\n<strong>Languages</strong> Common, Kumbric, telepathy 60 ft.<br>\n<strong>Challenge</strong> 9 (5,000 XP)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Witnessed.</strong> For the first time in a millennium, Yackle is truly seen. She is vulnerable to radiant damage and cannot hide or become invisible by any means. However, being witnessed also makes her fully real\u2014she can now experience pain, joy, connection, and ultimately, death.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Binding Fragments.</strong> Yackle retains fragments of the Eight Bindings' power based on collected secrets (see Secret Benefits table, but at reduced effectiveness).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spellcasting (Reduced).</strong> Yackle retains access to her spells but has fewer slots:\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding-left: 20px;\">\n<li><strong>Cantrips:</strong> At will</li>\n<li><strong>1st-3rd level:</strong> 3 slots each</li>\n<li><strong>4th-5th level:</strong> 2 slots each</li>\n<li><strong>6th-7th level:</strong> 1 slot each</li>\n<li><strong>8th+ level:</strong> None</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes two Void Touch attacks or casts a spell and makes one Void Touch attack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Void Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a humanoid with 50 hit points or fewer, Yackle can attempt to possess it (DC 17 Charisma save to resist). On a failed save, Yackle's consciousness enters the target's body (see Possession below).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unmaking Scream (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Yackle releases a psychic scream that embodies a thousand years of loneliness. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) psychic damage on a failure or half on a success. Creatures who fail are also stunned until the end of their next turn.</p>\n\n<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>\n\n<p>Yackle has 3 legendary actions in this phase:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cantrip.</strong> Yackle casts a cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Move.</strong> Yackle moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Yackle casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Binding Lash (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> One shadow thread from an anchor lashes out. Melee weapon attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., 18 (4d6+4) necrotic damage and target is grappled (escape DC 17).</p>\n\n<h4>The Anchor Points</h4>\n\n<p>Three glowing nodes where shadow threads connect Yackle's body to the walls. These represent her connection to PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AC:</strong> 12</li>\n<li><strong>HP:</strong> 30 each</li>\n<li><strong>Immune to:</strong> Necrotic, psychic damage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When an anchor is destroyed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yackle takes 20 damage</li>\n<li>Yackle loses 1 legendary action permanently</li>\n<li>Yackle can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When all three anchors are destroyed, Yackle's connection to time itself is severed. She becomes untethered, which triggers either her Final Moment (if she has fewer than 8 secrets) or Phase 4 (if she has collected all 8 secrets).</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3>Possession Mechanic</h3>\n<p>If Yackle successfully possesses a character:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The character's consciousness is suppressed but aware</li>\n<li>Yackle controls the body for 1 minute or until forced out</li>\n<li>Allies can attempt to expel her: <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 17), <em>protection from evil and good</em>, or dealing 30+ psychic/radiant damage to the possessed character</li>\n<li>If expelled, Yackle takes 4d10 psychic damage and cannot attempt possession again for 1 minute</li>\n<li>This is Yackle's desperate attempt to survive\u2014by taking a new vessel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Phase 4: Ascendant (CR 15) - ONLY IF ALL 8 SECRETS COLLECTED</h3>\n<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> Yackle has collected all eight secrets (all eight inversions), and all three anchors are destroyed. Instead of dissolution, she transcends\u2014becoming something beyond the Bindings, a truly immortal entity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is a near-TPK scenario. It should only occur if the party revealed all their secrets to Yackle. This represents the worst-case outcome.</p>\n\n<div class=\"stat-block\" style=\"border: 2px solid #8B0000; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #2a0000; color: #fff;\">\n<h4>Yackle Ascendant (Phase 4)</h4>\n<p><em>Medium aberration (primordial god), chaotic evil</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 18 (reality warping)<br>\n<strong>Hit Points</strong> 250 (20d8 + 150)<br>\n<strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft., fly 40 ft.

She can rewrite local reality within the house. Once per round as a free action, she can alter one aspect of the environment (change terrain, create walls, eliminate cover, etc.).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eight Inversions Manifest.</strong> Yackle can use the powers of all eight collected secrets simultaneously (see Eight Inversion Attacks below).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regeneration.</strong> Yackle regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and hasn't taken radiant damage since her last turn.</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes three attacks using any combination of Void Touch, Inversion Strike, or spells.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Void Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 6) necrotic damage, and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by the damage taken.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion Strike.</strong> Yackle channels one of the eight inversions as an attack (see Eight Inversion Attacks table below). Each can be used once per round.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unmaking Wave (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Yackle releases a wave of unmaking energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) psychic damage on a failure or half on a success. Creatures who fail are also stunned until the end of their next turn and forget their most recent action.</p>\n\n<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>\n\n<p>Yackle can take 5 legendary actions, choosing from the options below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cantrip.</strong> Yackle casts a cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Move.</strong> Yackle moves or teleports up to her speed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion Strike (Costs 1 Action).</strong> Yackle uses one Inversion Strike.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Yackle casts a spell of 5th level or lower.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reality Warp (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> Yackle fundamentally alters reality in a 30-foot radius. All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or be teleported to a random location within the house, take 4d10 force damage, and be disoriented (disadvantage on attacks and saves until end of next turn).</p>\n\n<h4>Eight Inversion Attacks</h4>\n\n<p>Yackle can use each of these once per round as part of Inversion Strike:</p>\n\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 16px 0; color: #fff;\">\n<tr style=\"background: #400000;\">\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #600; padding: 8px;\">Inversion</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #600; padding: 8px;\">Attack</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #600; padding: 8px;\"><strong>False Memory (Averic)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #600; padding: 8px;\">Target makes DC 18 Int save or forgets who their allies are for 1 minute (treats them as strangers).

The entire house warps to her will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Walls of Oblivion:</strong> Walls of solidified void appear. 20-foot walls, AC 15, 50 HP. Block line of sight and movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Gravity Reversal:</strong> Gravity reverses in one room. All creatures take 3d6 fall damage and are prone.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Loop:</strong> One creature must repeat their last turn exactly (same actions, same targets if possible).</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Harvest:</strong> All creatures in the house lose one prepared spell or regain one fewer hit die on their next rest.</li>\n<li><strong>The House Hungers:</strong> The house itself attacks. 3d10 force damage to all creatures, Dex save DC 18 for half.</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3>Defeating Phase 4</h3>\n\n<p>Phase 4 Yackle is extraordinarily dangerous. To defeat her:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Radiant Damage:</strong> She has no resistance to radiant damage. Focus holy magic, sunlight, divine power.</li>\n<li><strong>Lurline's Word:</strong> If found in the puzzle box, this deals 4d10 radiant damage automatically, no save.</li>\n<li><strong>Unmaking Phrase:</strong> If pieced together from Binding lore, stuns Yackle for 1 round (only works once).</li>\n<li><strong>Destroy Her Will:</strong> Reduce her to 0 HP. At 0 HP, she makes one final attack, then dissolves into nothingness with a scream that shatters all glass in the house.</li>\n<li><strong>The House Collapses:</strong> When Phase 4 Yackle is defeated, the house immediately begins collapsing. Players have 3 rounds to escape or be buried (10d10 bludgeoning damage per round after round 3).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Defeat Conditions (All Phases)</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle can be defeated through:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Combat Victory:</strong> Reduce her to 0 HP in Phase 3 (or Phase 4 if it occurs). She dissolves into dust.</li>\n<li><strong>Mercy/Peaceful Dissolution:</strong> In Phase 3, if offered genuine understanding and compassion, Yackle can choose to let go. This requires extraordinary roleplaying and a DC 20 Persuasion or Insight check. She fades peacefully, the house becomes mundane, and the players escape unharmed.</li>\n<li><strong>Re-Binding:</strong> A character can volunteer to stay as the house's warden, binding Yackle but keeping her alive. The house remains sentient, Yackle remains trapped, and the volunteer becomes the new keeper. This is a bittersweet ending\u2014one player sacrifices freedom to prevent Yackle's destruction.</li>\n<li><strong>Exorcism:</strong> In Phase 2 or 3, powerful divine magic (<em>dispel evil and good</em>, <em>banishment</em>, etc.) combined with a DC 20 Religion check can forcibly banish Yackle. She screams and dissolves, but her last words curse the caster with haunting dreams.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Tactics by Phase</h2>\n\n<h3>Phase 1 Tactics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Opens with <em>greater invisibility</em> or <em>time stop</em> to position advantageously</li>\n<li>Focuses on extracting remaining secrets via Kumbric Extraction</li>\n<li>Targets spellcasters first, using <em>counterspell</em> liberally</li>\n<li>Uses <em>dominate person</em> on fighters to turn them against the party</li>\n<li>Retreats via <em>dimension door</em> when bloodied</li>\n<li>Uses Memory Drain to sustain herself while dealing psychic damage</li>\n<li>Exploits collected secrets ruthlessly (see Secret Benefits table)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Phase 2 Tactics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Attacks from unexpected angles\u2014walls, ceilings, mirrors</li>\n<li>Separates the party by sealing rooms</li>\n<li>Overwhelms with animated objects and lair actions</li>\n<li>Uses Shift Geometry to disorient and confuse</li>\n<li>Focuses attacks on anyone trying to reach the cellar</li>\n<li>Creates choke points with debris and sealed doors</li>\n<li>Uses Whispers of the Dead to demoralize</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Phase 3 Tactics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fights desperately\u2014she knows this is her last chance</li>\n<li>Attempts possession on low-HP targets</li>\n<li>Uses anchors as cover, forcing players to divide attention</li>\n<li>Casts high-damage spells even when it hurts her</li>\n<li>If near death (below 50 HP), begs, bargains, lies, and offers deals</li>\n<li>Makes philosophical arguments: \"I only wanted to exist.

For a moment, you see her as she once was\u2014before the Bindings, before the loneliness, when she was just a fragment of chaos given form. Young. Curious. Terrified of oblivion. Then that vision fades. Her last words echo: \"I only wanted... to see tomorrow. To be seen today. Thank you... for witnessing me.\" The house groans. The walls crack. You have minutes to escape before it collapses entirely.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>If Shown Mercy (Peaceful Dissolution)</h3>\n<blockquote>\nShe stares at you, disbelieving. Tears stream down her ancient face\u2014the first tears in a millennium. \"You would... spare me? Give me... peace?\" For a long moment, she simply stands there, being seen, being witnessed, being real. Then she smiles\u2014genuinely smiles. \"I don't remember how to say thank you. But I remember this: you are kind. Kinder than I deserved.\" She fades, not into death, but into something gentler\u2014dissolution without pain, release without violence. The house sighs, released from bondage. The walls settle. You are free to leave.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>If Defeated in Phase 4</h3>\n<blockquote>\nShe screams\u2014not in pain, but in fury and denial. \"NO! I WAS BEYOND! I WAS FREE!\" Her form fractures, reality warping around her. For a terrible moment, you see all her faces\u2014every life she consumed, every mask she wore, a thousand years of stolen existence\u2014and then she shatters like broken glass. The house shudders violently. Walls crack. The ceiling collapses. You hear her voice one final time, distant and fading: \"I will return... I will always return... I am what refuses to end...\" Then silence. Then the sound of the house tearing itself apart. RUN.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Yackle's Backstory (For GM Reference)</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle was never born. She was created\u2014an accidental consequence of Lurline's first Word, REMEMBER. When Lurline imposed order on the Kumbric Void, fragments of pre-creation chaos were given structure. Most dissolved. Yackle... remembered. And in remembering, she became.</p>\n\n<p>For her first century, she was simply a wandering consciousness, trying to understand what it meant to exist. She studied at Shiz. She loved. She learned. But the eighth Binding\u2014Witness\u2014trapped her: she existed only because she remained unseen. True witnessing would shatter her.</p>\n\n<p>She spent centuries trying to break free:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First ritual (Year 347): Tried to become truly alive by consuming memories</li>\n<li>Second ritual (Year 523): Tried to become truly dead through sacrifice</li>\n<li>Third through seventh rituals: Failed attempts at transcendence</li>\n<li>Eighth ritual (Year 954): The Witch's Wake\u2014her final attempt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>She is not evil by nature. She is what happens when an unintended existence desperately tries to become real\u2014or to finally end.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake</a> - Full adventure</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate</a> - The lair (22 rooms)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/the-seven-seals', 'The Seven Seals'); return false;\">The Seven Seals</a> - Puzzle system</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> - Cosmological lore</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/house-horrors', 'House Horrors'); return false;\">House Horrors</a> - Minions and hazards</li>\n</ul>",

Averic preserves a memory that never existed, a false past he created.</p>\n<p><strong>If Secret Collected:</strong> Yackle gains advantage on saving throws against his spells.

He carries guilt like a lodestone\u2014not for the forgery itself, which he's rationalized away, but for the fear of being discovered. He over-explains everything, compulsively cross-references his statements, and treats conversation like peer review. His dedication to \"preserving truth\" is both genuine and deeply ironic; he truly believes in accuracy, which makes his founding lie all the more corrosive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constantly writes in his journal, even during conversations</li>\n<li>Says \"For the record\" and \"As documented in...\" obsessively</li>\n<li>Adjusts his spectacles when nervous (which is often)</li>\n<li>Touches the leather folio containing the forged letters like a talisman</li>\n<li>Corrects minor factual errors with uncomfortable intensity</li>\n<li>Speaks in perfectly structured paragraphs with verbal footnotes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What He Wants:</strong> To prove his academic worth through legitimate scholarship, to bury the original sin so deep it becomes irrelevant, to be remembered for discoveries rather than discoveries about him.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> 34</li>\n<li><strong>Height/Build:</strong> 5'10\", slender, poor posture from years hunched over books</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Pale skin with ink-stained fingers, prematurely graying brown hair always disheveled, wire-rim spectacles perpetually sliding down his nose, dark circles under observant hazel eyes</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Academic robes in Gillikinese purple, ink-stained cuffs, numerous pockets filled with notebooks and writing implements, a leather satchel that never leaves his side</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing Marks:</strong> Permanent ink stain on his right middle finger, a nervous habit of touching the bridge of his spectacles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>The Forgery</h3>\n<p>Averic was a promising graduate student at Shiz University twelve years ago\u2014talented but unremarkable, lost in a cohort of brilliant minds. His mentor, Professor Lenx, was a celebrated historian who barely noticed Averic among his many students. When Lenx died suddenly, Averic saw an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>He spent three months studying Lenx's handwriting, researching obscure admissions records, and crafting a series of letters that \"revealed\" how wealthy families bought their children's way into Shiz. The letters were compelling, detailed, and utterly fabricated. Averic \"discovered\" them among Lenx's papers and published them with extensive commentary.</p>\n\n<p>The scandal catapulted Averic to academic prominence. He became the keeper of Lenx's legacy, the scholar who exposed institutional corruption, the brave truth-teller. Universities offered him positions. Journals solicited his work. He built an entire career on documentation, verification, and academic integrity\u2014all founded on a lie.</p>\n\n<h3>The Weight of Success</h3>\n<p>For a decade, Averic has lived in fear of discovery. He's preserved the forged letters with archival care, making them as legitimate as possible through meticulous documentation. He's become genuinely skilled at his work, producing real scholarship to bury the false foundation. But every accolade feels hollow, every citation a reminder.</p>\n\n<p>He tells himself it doesn't matter\u2014the letters exposed a truth even if they weren't true themselves. Wealthy families did buy admissions; he just couldn't prove it legitimately. He's done good work since. The forgery was a youthful mistake that enabled genuine contributions.</p>\n\n<p>He almost believes this. Almost.</p>\n\n<h3>The Invitation</h3>\n<p>When Averic received the invitation to Yackle's estate, he saw it as validation\u2014a reclusive scholar recognizing his work. But the invitation mentioned \"shared interests in preserved memories\" and \"the documentation of things that should be forgotten.\" The phrasing unsettled him.</p>\n\n<p>He came anyway, because he's drawn to mysteries, and because some part of him wants to be caught. Wants the weight lifted, even if it destroys him.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>\n\n<h3>Basic Stats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 13 (studded leather)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 27 (5d8)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative:</strong> +3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ability Scores</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>\n<tr><td>8 (-1)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>18 (+4)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>12 (+1)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Intelligence +7, Wisdom +5</li>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Arcana +7, History +10 (expertise), Investigation +10 (expertise), Insight +5, Perception +5, Religion +7</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Gillikinese, Ancient Ozian, Quadling, Munchkinlander, Elvish</li>\n<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Calligrapher's supplies, forgery kit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Scholar Class Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bardic Inspiration (d8):</strong> 4/day - Called \"Scholarly Insight,\" represents sharing knowledge to bolster allies</li>\n<li><strong>Jack of All Trades:</strong> +2 to any ability check that doesn't use proficiency bonus</li>\n<li><strong>Song of Rest (d6):</strong> Represented as \"Lectures on Recovery,\" soothing academic discourse during short rests</li>\n<li><strong>Expertise:</strong> History, Investigation</li>\n<li><strong>Font of Inspiration:</strong> Regain Bardic Inspiration on short rest</li>\n<li><strong>College of Lore Features:</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Bonus Proficiencies:</strong> Insight, Perception, Religion</li>\n  <li><strong>Cutting Words:</strong> 3/day, use Bardic Inspiration die to reduce enemy attack/ability check/damage (reaction)</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p><strong>Spell Save DC:</strong> 15<br>\n<strong>Spell Attack Bonus:</strong> +7<br>\n<strong>Spell Slots:</strong> 1st (4), 2nd (3), 3rd (2)</p>\n\n<h4>Spells Known</h4>\n<p><strong>Cantrips:</strong> Mage Hand, Message, Prestidigitation, Vicious Mockery</p>\n\n<p><strong>1st Level:</strong> Comprehend Languages, Detect Magic, Identify, Sleep, Thunderwave</p>\n\n<p><strong>2nd Level:</strong> Detect Thoughts, Hold Person, Locate Object, Suggestion</p>\n\n<p><strong>3rd Level:</strong> Counterspell, Dispel Magic, Tongues</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: As a Scholar (reflavored Bard), spells are cast through recited knowledge, historical precedent, and academic authority rather than music.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rapier</strong> (1d8 piercing, finesse) - Ornamental, rarely used</li>\n<li><strong>Light Crossbow</strong> (1d8 piercing, 80/320 ft., ammunition, loading, two-handed) with 20 bolts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Studded Leather Armor</strong> (AC 12 + Dex modifier)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tools & Supplies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Calligrapher's supplies</li>\n<li>Forgery kit (hidden in false bottom of satchel)</li>\n<li>Five journals filled with notes and observations</li>\n<li>Two blank journals for new documentation</li>\n<li>Extensive writing implements (quills, inks, sealing wax)</li>\n<li>Magnifying glass</li>\n<li>Academic seal and stamp</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Forged Letters</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Seven letters on aged paper, sealed in a protective leather folio with archival tissue paper. Appear to be 12 years old, written in Professor Lenx's handwriting (which Averic studied obsessively).</li>\n<li><strong>Content:</strong> Detailed allegations of admissions corruption at Shiz University, naming specific families and amounts paid. Convincingly written in Lenx's academic style.</li>\n<li><strong>Averic's Relationship:</strong> He keeps them with him always, has \"preserved\" them with such care they've become nearly indistinguishable from legitimate historical documents.

He over-documents, over-cites, and obsessively verifies because he's trying to bury one enormous lie under a mountain of meticulous truth.</p>\n\n<h3>Quirks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Writes everything down immediately, even in dangerous situations</li>\n<li>Becomes visibly distressed if asked about his early career</li>\n<li>Defends Professor Lenx's reputation with uncomfortable intensity</li>\n<li>Has memorized the exact wording of all seven forged letters</li>\n<li>Practices Lenx's handwriting in private, even now (compulsion he can't stop)</li>\n<li>Treats his journals as more important than his own safety</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Guidance</h2>\n\n<h3>Speech Patterns</h3>\n<p>Averic speaks in formal, structured sentences with frequent academic references:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"As documented in the Third History of Shiz, the architectural period suggests...\"</li>\n<li>\"For the record, that's the fourth unexplained phenomenon we've encountered.\"</li>\n<li>\"If I may interject a point of historical context...\"</li>\n<li>\"I should note\u2014and I will note, in my journal\u2014that...\"</li>\n<li>\"According to established precedent, cross-referenced with the Lenx papers...\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>In Different Rooms</h3>\n\n<h4>The Library</h4>\n<p>This is Averic's element, but also his terror. He becomes excited examining books, taking notes, cross-referencing\u2014but any mention of forgeries, false documents, or academic fraud causes visible distress. He might find books about detecting forgeries and compulsively read them, unable to help himself.</p>\n\n<h4>The Study</h4>\n<p>He's drawn to Yackle's personal papers and documents. He can't resist analyzing handwriting, examining seals, dating materials. If he finds evidence of historical manipulation or false records, it both fascinates and horrifies him\u2014he's looking in a mirror.</p>\n\n<h4>The Dining Room</h4>\n<p>During dinner, he documents everything\u2014who sits where, what's served, exact quotes from conversation. Other characters might find this annoying or paranoid. He's most relaxed when people ask him about his research (the legitimate parts), most tense when conversation turns to academic integrity.</p>\n\n<h4>The Portrait Gallery</h4>\n<p>He analyzes painting techniques, dates periods, identifies artistic schools\u2014all defense mechanisms against the portraits' unsettling qualities. He might notice details others miss because he's trained to examine documents for authenticity. Ironically, he's excellent at spotting forgeries.</p>\n\n<h4>During Combat</h4>\n<p>Averic fights like someone who learned combat from books\u2014technically correct but lacking practical experience. He uses spells that control, reveal truth, or counter enemy abilities. His Cutting Words feature manifests as devastating academic critiques: \"Your form is derivative!\" \"That's a logical fallacy!\" He protects his journals even when doing so is tactically unsound.</p>\n\n<h3>Emotional Beats</h3>\n\n<h4>Guilt</h4>\n<p>When someone praises his work on the Lenx papers, he becomes quiet, withdrawn. Changes subject quickly. Touching the leather folio is both comfort and punishment.</p>\n\n<h4>Fear</h4>\n<p>Any suggestion that someone might examine the original letters too closely triggers panic. He becomes defensive, over-explanatory, almost aggressive in protecting \"Lenx's legacy.\"</p>\n\n<h4>Genuine Pride</h4>\n<p>When he solves a mystery or reveals hidden information through legitimate scholarship, his joy is real and childlike. These moments show who he could have been without the forgery.</p>\n\n<h4>Connection</h4>\n<p>If another character shares a secret or shows vulnerability, Averic almost confesses. Almost. He wants desperately to be known and forgiven but can't bring himself to speak the words.</p>\n\n<h2>The Secret's Role</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Secret</h3>\n<p>The GM can leverage Averic's secret in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Library:</strong> Books about Professor Lenx, or forgery detection manuals, or records that contradict the letters' claims</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Knowledge:</strong> She might have correspondence from the real Lenx, proving the letters are fake</li>\n<li><strong>Other Characters:</strong> If someone mentions studying under Lenx, or questions the letters' authenticity, or admires Averic's \"brave exposure of corruption\"</li>\n<li><strong>Magical Revelation:</strong> Zone of Truth, Detect Thoughts, or Yackle's insight could force confrontation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Potential Reveals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voluntary Confession:</strong> Under extreme stress, Averic might confess to another character, seeking absolution</li>\n<li><strong>Magical Compulsion:</strong> Yackle forces the truth out during Phase 2 or 3</li>\n<li><strong>Evidence Found:</strong> Players discover Averic's practice sheets in his journals, showing him copying Lenx's handwriting</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Monologue:</strong> She reveals it herself: \"Tell them about Lenx, Scholar. Tell them who really wrote those letters.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Secret</h3>\n<p>If Averic's secret is revealed and he survives, he experiences devastating relief. The weight he's carried for twelve years lifts. He might lose his academic position, but he's finally free to do legitimate work. Or he might double down, claiming Yackle lied, unable to face the consequences.</p>\n\n<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>\n\n<h3>Why She Chose Him</h3>\n<p>Yackle selected Averic because he embodies Memory's inversion\u2014a man who preserves a past that never existed, who built truth on lies, who documents fiction so thoroughly it becomes history. He's a perfect offering to the Kumbric Void: a scholar whose entire career is founded on something that should be forgotten.</p>\n\n<h3>How She'll Use Him</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects Averic's secret, she gains power over documentation, verification, and the authority of written truth. She might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forge reality itself, creating \"documented\" events that never happened</li>\n<li>Erase or alter written records throughout the estate</li>\n<li>Make others forget what they've learned or documented</li>\n<li>Turn Averic's own scholarship against him, making him unable to trust anything he reads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Confrontation</h3>\n<p>When Yackle reveals knowledge of the forgery, Averic might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deny:</strong> \"You're lying! Professor Lenx wrote those letters!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Bargain:</strong> \"Please\u2014I've done real work since then, legitimate scholarship\u2014\"</li>\n<li><strong>Break:</strong> Collapse into confession, seeking punishment he feels he deserves</li>\n<li><strong>Rage:</strong> Attack her for threatening to destroy everything he's built</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Averic</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize his compulsive documentation\u2014he writes during conversations, combat, even moments of terror</li>\n<li>Show the contradiction: he's genuinely skilled and deeply fraudulent</li>\n<li>Use his expertise to provide the party with historical knowledge and puzzle solutions</li>\n<li>Make him endearing\u2014his obsessiveness is annoying but comes from deep insecurity</li>\n<li>When the secret emerges, play the relief alongside the devastation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Combat Role</h3>\n<p>Averic is a controller and support caster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <em>Detect Thoughts</em> and <em>Identify</em> to gather information</li>\n<li><em>Counterspell</em> and <em>Dispel Magic</em> to shut down enemy magic</li>\n<li><em>Hold Person</em> and <em>Suggestion</em> to control enemies</li>\n<li>Bardic Inspiration to boost ally rolls (flavored as timely advice)</li>\n<li>Cutting Words to debuff enemies (academic criticism as psychic damage)</li>\n<li>He's physically fragile\u2014prioritize staying behind the party</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Character Arc Potential</h3>\n<p>If this becomes a longer campaign, Averic's arc involves choosing between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuing the lie and living with the guilt</li>\n<li>Confessing and accepting consequences</li>\n<li>Finding a way to make amends without destroying himself</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>His relationship with other party members, especially if they show him grace despite his fraud, could be transformative. The question becomes: Can someone built on a lie become genuine? Can he document his own redemption?</p>\n\n<h2>Relationships with Other Pre-Gens</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Heir:</strong> Fascinated by the Ostrega lineage claim, might have researched the family.

You can secure audiences with local nobility, access family records and archives, and are generally assumed to be trustworthy and of good breeding. However, this privilege is built entirely on fraud.

You must live up to it, even if you didn't earn it. (Lawful)</p>\n\n<h3>Bond</h3>\n<p>The Ostrega name gave me purpose when I had none. I will protect it at any cost\u2014even though I know I have no right to it.</p>\n\n<h3>Flaw</h3>\n<p>I'm terrified of being exposed as a fraud, so I overcompensate by being rigidly honorable in all other things.</p>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>The Truth</h3>\n<p>Liir Opp was born to nobody important. His parents were laborers in a Gillikinese mill town. When he was sixteen, they died in a factory collapse. He had no money, no prospects, no future. He joined the local militia because they'd take anyone with two working arms.</p>\n\n<p>He was good at it. Strong, disciplined, a natural tactician. He rose through the ranks, made sergeant by age twenty-three. But he was still \"Opp, the orphan\" to the officers. No family name. No connections. No respect.</p>\n\n<h3>The Forgery</h3>\n<p>At age twenty-five, he met a clerk named Tarvin who worked in the Gillikinese Hall of Records. Over drinks, Tarvin mentioned how easy it would be to \"adjust\" old genealogy records\u2014how noble families sometimes paid to have inconvenient branches pruned or convenient ancestors added.</p>\n\n<p>Liir asked: \"How much would it cost to add someone?\"</p>\n\n<p>Three months' salary. That's what it cost to become an Ostrega.</p>\n\n<p>Tarvin found him a perfect insertion point: a scandal from eighty years ago, an illegitimate daughter quietly paid off and sent away. Records showed she'd married a man named Opp. No children listed\u2014easy to add one. Liir's \"great-grandmother.\"</p>\n\n<p>Within a year, Liir had commissioned a signet ring, purchased an \"heirloom\" sword, and begun using the name \"Liir Opp of the Ostrega Line\" in official documents.</p>\n\n<h3>The Consequences</h3>\n<p>It worked. Doors opened. He was invited to officers' clubs. Recommended for commissions he'd never have received as \"just Opp.\" People assumed he was educated, cultured, trustworthy\u2014all because of a name.</p>\n\n<p>And he worked obsessively to live up to it. He became the most honorable soldier in his unit. He never lied (about anything except his blood). He protected civilians. He followed every regulation to the letter.</p>\n\n<p>Because if he didn't, someone might look too closely. Someone might ask questions.</p>\n\n<h3>The Inheritance Letter</h3>\n<p>When the letter from Mr. Trism arrived, naming him as an heir to Yackle Ostreaga's estate, Liir's first reaction was panic. He'd never heard of Yackle Ostreaga. He'd researched the Ostrega family enough to forge documents, but not exhaustively.</p>\n\n<p>His second reaction: if there's an actual Ostrega estate, and they've called him as an heir, maybe his fraud will be exposed.</p>\n\n<p>His third reaction: or maybe this legitimizes the lie.

Sweating.</li>\n<li><strong>When Questioned:</strong> Becomes stiff, defensive. \"My lineage is documented.

That part isn't fake.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Tips</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Liir Effectively</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Imposter:</strong> You're constantly performing. Every interaction is a test. Can they tell you're a fraud?</li>\n<li><strong>Overcompensation:</strong> You're the MOST honorable person in the room. The MOST disciplined. The MOST proper. Because if you slip even once, they'll see through you.</li>\n<li><strong>The Tank:</strong> In combat, you're genuine. You protect people. You follow tactics. This is the one thing you're actually good at that isn't a lie.</li>\n<li><strong>The Secret:</strong> You're terrified of it coming out. But there's also a tiny part of you that wants it to\u2014that wants to stop lying, to be seen for who you actually are.</li>\n<li><strong>Character Arc Potential:</strong> Will you realize that honor isn't about blood\u2014it's about choices? That you've EARNED respect through your actions, even if your name is fake?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Character Hooks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>At the cemetery: \"Ostrega. All of them. My... family.\" (pause, guilt)</li>\n<li>In the Portrait Gallery: \"I don't see her. My great-grandmother. She should be here.\"</li>\n<li>When challenged: \"I have documentation. Signed. Sealed. Legal.\" (too defensive)</li>\n<li>When protecting someone: \"Get behind me. Whatever you think of my family, I know how to fight.\"</li>\n<li>If the secret comes out: \"You want the truth?

He appears to be Frederick Vawn, a quiet Munchkinlander clerk from Rush Margins. <strong>THE SECRET:</strong> He's a Fox. Capital-A Animal, fully sentient. He's been living as a human for twelve years\u2014forged papers, practiced voice, carefully tailored clothes to hide his tail. Every interaction, every relationship, every moment of his life is a performance of being something he fundamentally is not.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Secret:</strong> The Animal underground sent him here. They believe Yackle's library contains information about how Animals were created/awakened\u2014knowledge that could help them. He's on a mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Binding Inversion:</strong> Nature says beings are their kind. Frederick IS other than what he appears\u2014a being denying their essential nature every moment of every day.</p>\n<p><strong>If Secret Collected:</strong> Yackle can cast <em>Dominate Person</em> on him once with no concentration; lasts until he takes damage from her.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Character Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Frederick Vawn (Human name) / Quick-Paw (True name)<br>\n<strong>True Race:</strong> Fox Animal<br>\n<strong>Apparent Race:</strong> Munchkinlander Human<br>\n<strong>Class:</strong> Agent 5 (Infiltrator)<br>\n<strong>Background:</strong> Criminal (Spy)<br>\n<strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral Good</p>\n\n<h2>Personality Summary</h2>\n<p>Frederick lives in a state of perpetual, quiet terror. Every moment requires performance: the way humans hold their hands, the rhythm of human laughter, the unconscious mannerisms that mark someone as genuinely comfortable in their own skin. He's hyper-observant, always watching others to perfect his mimicry. He's kind but distant, helpful but never intimate\u2014closeness means risk of discovery.</p>\n\n<p>Beneath the fear, there's a fierce, barely-acknowledged anger. He shouldn't have to hide. He shouldn't have to pretend his thoughts are simpler than they are, his soul less real. But anger is dangerous, so he buries it deep and keeps his head down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusts his collar constantly (hiding where fur meets human illusion)</li>\n<li>Speaks with a studied Munchkinlander rural accent, occasionally slips into more formal speech when stressed</li>\n<li>Freezes completely still when startled (fox instinct)</li>\n<li>Excellent hearing\u2014reacts to sounds others haven't noticed yet, has to pretend he didn't hear</li>\n<li>Sits with his back to walls, always knows where exits are</li>\n<li>Eats sparingly in public, claims a \"nervous stomach\"</li>\n<li>Keeps gloves on whenever possible (paw pads are difficult to disguise)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What He Wants:</strong> To complete his mission for the Underground, to survive long enough to see a world where he doesn't have to hide, to know whether the constant fear will ever end.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n\n<h3>Human Disguise (What Others See)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> Appears late 20s</li>\n<li><strong>Height/Build:</strong> 5'6\", slight build, moves with nervous energy</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Reddish-brown hair kept short, sharp features, amber-brown eyes that seem a bit too bright, pale skin with a faint ruddy undertone</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Carefully tailored Munchkinlander clerk's attire\u2014high collars, long sleeves, gloves, everything designed to cover. Dark blue coat, sturdy trousers, well-worn boots. Everything is slightly too loose to hide his true form beneath.</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing Marks:</strong> Moves with uncanny quiet, extremely light-footed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>True Form (What He Really Is)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Species:</strong> Red fox, fully anthropomorphic</li>\n<li><strong>Height:</strong> 5'4\" at shoulder (bipedal stance)</li>\n<li><strong>Fur:</strong> Red-gold with white throat and underbelly, black \"socks\" on forearms and legs</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Sharp muzzle, upright triangular ears, golden eyes with slit pupils, full brush tail</li>\n<li><strong>Voice:</strong> Slightly higher pitch than his human disguise, no accent in his natural speech</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Disguise Magic</h3>\n<p>Frederick uses a combination of expertly tailored clothing, careful posture, and a minor glamour (Ring of Disguise, attuned) to maintain his human appearance. The ring does most of the visual work, but he's learned to move like a human, speak like a human, eat like a human. The performance is as important as the magic.</p>\n\n<p>If the ring is removed or suppressed (antimagic field, etc.), his true form is revealed.</p>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>Quick-Paw</h3>\n<p>Twelve years ago, Quick-Paw was a young fox living in the forests outside Rush Margins. He was clever, curious, and had just begun to understand that his thoughts were *different*\u2014more complex than his littermates, full of words and questions and a terrible, wonderful awareness of self.</p>\n\n<p>He was also terrified. In the Munchkinlands, being a sentient Animal meant death or cages. The Gale Force was rounding up \"speaking beasts,\" and the local Unionists preached that Animal consciousness was theological impossibility, demonic deception.</p>\n\n<p>Quick-Paw knew he had to hide. Not just in the woods\u2014hide *as a human*.</p>\n\n<h3>Becoming Frederick</h3>\n<p>He found the Animal Underground\u2014a network of hidden Animals and sympathetic humans who helped sentient creatures escape persecution. They gave him the Ring of Disguise. They taught him to walk upright without looking unnatural, to modulate his voice, to eat cooked food without gagging.</p>\n\n<p>They gave him Frederick Vawn's papers. Frederick had been a real person\u2014a clerk who died in a fire with no family to miss him. Quick-Paw became Frederick: practiced his signature, memorized his history, took his job at a textile merchant's office in Rush Margins.</p>\n\n<p>For twelve years, Quick-Paw has been Frederick Vawn. He pays taxes. He has colleagues who invite him to dinner (he always declines). He has a landlady who thinks he's \"such a quiet young man, very polite.\"</p>\n\n<p>No one knows. No one can ever know.</p>\n\n<h3>The Mission</h3>\n<p>Three months ago, the Underground contacted Frederick with a request. They'd received intelligence that Yackle's estate\u2014long thought empty\u2014might contain texts about the origin of Animal sentience. How it happens. Why some creatures wake and others don't. Whether it can be controlled, spread, *proven* to the Unionists who claim it's impossible.</p>\n\n<p>This knowledge could change everything for Animals in Oz.</p>\n\n<p>Frederick's assignment: infiltrate the estate, find the texts, bring them back. The invitation to Yackle's will reading was arranged through Underground channels. His cover story\u2014Yackle once helped his \"family\" during hard times\u2014is a fabrication, but a plausible one.</p>\n\n<p>He's terrified. This is the most dangerous thing he's ever done. But if there's a chance to help his people, he has to try.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>\n\n<h3>Basic Stats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 16 (studded leather + Dex)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 35 (5d8 + 5)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 35 ft.

I owe them everything, including this mission.\" He'd die before betraying them.</p>\n\n<h3>Flaws</h3>\n<p><strong>Paranoia:</strong> \"Trust no one completely. One mistake means death.\" He can't fully relax, even around allies. Every new person is a potential threat.</p>\n\n<h3>Quirks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tilts his head when listening (fox habit, tries to suppress it)</li>\n<li>Excellent sense of smell\u2014sometimes reacts to scents others can't detect, has to cover</li>\n<li>Sleeps very lightly, wakes at the slightest sound</li>\n<li>Avoids dogs instinctively</li>\n<li>When truly relaxed (rare), his ears would perk up\u2014but the disguise hides this</li>\n<li>Sometimes forgets to blink for unsettling stretches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Guidance</h2>\n\n<h3>Speech Patterns</h3>\n<p>Frederick speaks with a carefully practiced Munchkinlander accent\u2014rural, simple, non-threatening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Oh, I wouldn't know about that, I'm just a clerk, really.\"</li>\n<li>\"Beggin' your pardon, but maybe we should be cautious-like?\"</li>\n<li>\"I ain't educated like some folks here, but seems to me...\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When stressed or surprised, the accent slips and his real voice emerges\u2014more articulate, slightly higher pitch, no regional markers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Stop. We need to think about this carefully.\"</li>\n<li>\"That's not random. Someone planned this.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>In Different Rooms</h3>\n\n<h4>The Library</h4>\n<p>This is what Frederick came for. He's searching for anything about Animal awakening, sentience origins, or consciousness studies. He tries to be subtle but becomes increasingly focused. If pressed, he claims he's \"just looking at the pretty books.\"</p>\n\n<p>If he finds relevant texts, he must decide: take them now (suspicious), memorize what he can (time-consuming), or wait until later (risky).</p>\n\n<h4>The Dining Room</h4>\n<p>Meals are dangerous. Frederick has to eat human food in a human way, make small talk, not react unusually to smells. He eats small portions, claims nervousness. If there's meat, he has to pretend it doesn't smell *exactly right* in a way that makes him deeply uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<h4>Any Sealed Room</h4>\n<p>Frederick is the party's lockpick and trap specialist. He's genuinely talented\u2014the Underground trained him well. He takes pride in this work because it's something he's good at that isn't performance. He can be himself when he's picking a lock.</p>\n\n<h4>The Portrait Gallery</h4>\n<p>If there are portraits of Yackle with Animals (as servants, pets, or specimens), Frederick reacts with barely-suppressed anger. He might linger, staring at painted foxes in cages, hounds on leashes. Others might notice his expression has gone cold and hard.</p>\n\n<h4>During Combat</h4>\n<p>Frederick fights with desperate, precise efficiency. He uses hit-and-run tactics, Cunning Action to stay mobile, Sneak Attack for devastating strikes. He protects the group because they're his temporary pack, but he's also calculating escape routes.</p>\n\n<p>If his disguise fails during combat, there's a moment of pure panic\u2014then he fights in his true form, faster and more feral.</p>\n\n<h3>Emotional Beats</h3>\n\n<h4>Fear</h4>\n<p>Constant low-level anxiety. Any mention of Animals, the Gale Force, Unionist doctrine, or identity verification makes him freeze, then deflect.</p>\n\n<h4>Loneliness</h4>\n<p>If someone shows him genuine kindness, he almost breaks. He wants so badly to be seen, to be known, but knowing means death.</p>\n\n<h4>Anger</h4>\n<p>Buried deep. Emerges when he sees injustice, prejudice, casual cruelty. He has to force it down, maintain the helpless clerk persona.</p>\n\n<h4>Hope</h4>\n<p>When he finds information about Animal sentience, or if someone speaks positively about Animals, he allows himself brief, painful hope that things might change.</p>\n\n<h2>The Secret's Role</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Secret</h3>\n<p>The GM can create tension around Frederick's nature in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Close Calls:</strong> His collar slips, revealing fur. Someone grabs his hand before he can put gloves back on, feeling paw pads. His reflection in a mirror flickers.</li>\n<li><strong>Antimagic:</strong> If the party encounters an antimagic field, his disguise fails. He must either avoid the area or be revealed.</li>\n<li><strong>Animals Recognize Him:</strong> If there are Animal servants or specimens in the house, they might react to him\u2014a caged parrot speaks to him in Animal language, a taxidermied fox's eyes seem to follow him.</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Knowledge:</strong> She might have books about the Animal Underground, maps showing safe houses, or even a portrait of a fox that looks disturbingly like Quick-Paw.</li>\n<li><strong>Combat Injury:</strong> If he takes significant damage, blood might reveal different biology, or pain might make him cry out in his true voice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Potential Reveals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voluntary:</strong> Frederick confesses to save another character's life, or when he realizes someone is genuinely trustworthy</li>\n<li><strong>Forced:</strong> Antimagic field, ring is stolen/removed, <em>Dispel Magic</em> targets him</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Reveal:</strong> During her monologue, she casually addresses him as \"Quick-Paw\" and his disguise shatters</li>\n<li><strong>Heroic Sacrifice:</strong> He removes the ring himself to access his full Animal speed/abilities to save someone</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Secret</h3>\n<p>If revealed and the party doesn't immediately turn on him:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overwhelming relief and terror</li>\n<li>He can stop performing, stop hiding</li>\n<li>But he's also more vulnerable\u2014will they protect him or report him?</li>\n<li>In combat, he gains his full Animal traits but might be too overwhelmed to use them effectively at first</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>\n\n<h3>Why She Chose Him</h3>\n<p>Yackle selected Frederick because he perfectly inverts Nature\u2014he IS not what he appears, living in constant denial of his essential self. Every moment of his existence contradicts the Binding that says beings are their kind. He's proof that nature can be hidden, denied, falsified.</p>\n\n<h3>How She'll Use Him</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects Frederick's secret, she gains power over identity, transformation, and the boundary between what is and what appears. She might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Force transformations\u2014making party members appear as monsters to each other</li>\n<li>Deny his true nature, trapping him in human form permanently</li>\n<li>Create illusions so perfect that reality becomes uncertain</li>\n<li>Dominate him completely, making him attack his allies while wearing their trust</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Confrontation</h3>\n<p>When Yackle addresses Frederick directly, she might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call him Quick-Paw, shattering his disguise</li>\n<li>Reveal she has records of the Underground, threatening everyone he's ever known</li>\n<li>Offer him freedom: \"Stay with me, little fox. No more hiding.\"</li>\n<li>Mock his mission: \"Did you really think I'd leave such knowledge unguarded?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Frederick</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize the constant performance\u2014he's always \"on\"</li>\n<li>Show the cracks: moments where the accent slips, the disguise flickers, the fear shows through</li>\n<li>Make him useful\u2014his skills (lockpicking, stealth, perception) should feel valuable to the party</li>\n<li>Play the paranoia: he hangs back, watches exits, startles easily</li>\n<li>When he's revealed, play the transformation: terror \u2192 relief \u2192 vulnerability \u2192 determination</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Combat Role</h3>\n<p>Frederick is a striker and scout:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive Sneak Attack damage when positioned well</li>\n<li>Cunning Action for mobility\u2014Disengage to escape danger, Hide to set up attacks</li>\n<li>Uncanny Dodge and Evasion make him surprisingly durable for a d8 hit die</li>\n<li>Assassinate is devastating if he gets surprise (advantage + autocrit)</li>\n<li>He should flank with melee allies to trigger Sneak Attack, or use Hide-attack-Hide with his bow</li>\n<li>If revealed as an Animal, he gains +5 ft. speed and bite/claw attacks as backup weapons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Mission</h3>\n<p>Don't forget Frederick has a secondary goal: find information about Animal sentience. The GM can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place relevant texts in the Library (Yackle might have firsthand knowledge of Lurline's creation)</li>\n<li>Make him choose between the mission and the party's safety</li>\n<li>Reveal that Yackle knows more about Animal awakening than anyone alive</li>\n<li>Use the mission as leverage: \"Get me information and I'll help you escape\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Relationships with Other Pre-Gens</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Scholar:</strong> Nervous around Averic's constant observation and documentation. Fears being studied too closely.</li>\n<li><strong>The Heir:</strong> Envies Liir's confidence (even though it's false).

She presents herself as a hereditary witch from a proud Arjiki lineage, wielding magic that flows through her bloodline. <strong>THE SECRET:</strong> Her magic is a transaction, not a gift. When her younger brother was dying, something answered her desperate plea\u2014but it wasn't charity. It was a <em>deal</em>. She traded something\u2014she doesn't know what, exactly\u2014but she feels the weight of it. Sometimes she does things she doesn't remember deciding to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Sacrifice Binding Inversion:</strong> Sacrifice says giving freely creates value. Sarima didn't give\u2014she <em>traded</em>. Her power is bought, not gifted.</p>\n<p><strong>If Secret Collected:</strong> Yackle can use one of Sarima's pact spell slots. Sarima has disadvantage on concentration saves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Character Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Sarima Qov<br>\n<strong>Race:</strong> Arjiki Human<br>\n<strong>Class:</strong> Witch 5 (Pact of the Talisman)<br>\n<strong>Background:</strong> Outlander (Arjiki Tribe)<br>\n<strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Neutral</p>\n\n<h2>Personality Summary</h2>\n<p>Sarima moves through the world with fierce pride and barely-concealed fear. She's proud of her Arjiki heritage, her supposed magical lineage, her strength in a world that wants her people erased. She's also terrified because she knows her power isn't hers\u2014not really. It belongs to something else, something that took a piece of her she can't name.</p>\n\n<p>She compensates with intensity: loud opinions, bold magic, defiant presence. She'll argue theology with Unionists, mock Gillikinese pretensions, and stand her ground when others back down. It's all armor. Beneath it, she's waiting for the other shoe to drop, for whatever she traded to come due.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Touches her talisman obsessively (bone medallion on leather cord)</li>\n<li>Speaks Arjiki phrases when agitated, especially curses</li>\n<li>Stares at her hands sometimes, as if they're not quite hers</li>\n<li>Laughs too loud, takes up space deliberately</li>\n<li>Gets defensive when asked about her magical training</li>\n<li>Sometimes trails off mid-sentence, looking confused, then snaps back</li>\n<li>Avoids making promises or oaths\u2014they feel dangerous</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What She Wants:</strong> To be strong enough that no one can take anything from her again, to protect what's left of her family, to understand what she really gave away and whether she can ever get it back.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> 29</li>\n<li><strong>Height/Build:</strong> 5'8\", strong and weathered from Vinkus life, moves like someone used to hard terrain</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Brown skin, dark eyes with an unsettling intensity, black hair worn in traditional Arjiki braids decorated with bone beads and colored thread. Geometric tattoos on her forearms (traditional Arjiki protective symbols).</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Vinkus practical wear\u2014leather and wool in earth tones, fur-lined cloak, sturdy boots. Heavy silver jewelry (traditional Arjiki pieces). Everything chosen to announce: I am Arjiki, and I'm not ashamed.</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing Marks:</strong> The bone talisman around her neck (carved with symbols she didn't choose), a thin scar across her left palm from the night she made the deal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>Arjiki Pride</h3>\n<p>Sarima was raised in an Arjiki tribe in the Vinkus\u2014a people the Wizard's regime tried to erase through resettlement, cultural suppression, and worse. Her grandmother told stories of the old ways: blood oaths, tribal magic, the sacred geography of the grasslands. Her mother taught her defiance: You are Arjiki. They can't take that.</p>\n\n<p>Sarima learned to be proud, loud, unbreakable. She learned Arjiki songs, wore traditional dress in Emerald City markets, spoke her language where Unionists insisted on Common. She was training to be a traditional healer\u2014herb lore, wound care, midwifery\u2014useful magic, not the flashy kind.</p>\n\n<p>She had no talent for real sorcery. None at all.</p>\n\n<h3>The Night Everything Changed</h3>\n<p>Fourteen years ago, Sarima's younger brother Litek fell ill. Nine years old, burning with fever, coughing blood. The nearest doctor was three days' ride and wouldn't treat \"nomads\" anyway. Her grandmother's herbs weren't working. Sarima watched him fade.</p>\n\n<p>She did what any desperate sister would do: she prayed. But not to Lurline, not to the Unnamed God. To <em>anything</em> that would listen.</p>\n\n<p>Something answered.</p>\n\n<p>It didn't speak in words. It was a <em>presence</em>, vast and cold and utterly indifferent. It showed her what it could do\u2014Litek, healthy, laughing, alive. And it showed her the price.</p>\n\n<p>Sarima doesn't remember agreeing. She doesn't remember what the price was. She remembers reaching out, feeling something <em>pull</em> from deep inside her\u2014not pain exactly, but <em>absence</em>, like losing a piece she didn't know was separate.</p>\n\n<p>When she woke, Litek's fever had broken. He recovered fully. And Sarima could do magic.</p>\n\n<h3>The Weight</h3>\n<p>For fourteen years, Sarima has told everyone she's a hereditary witch\u2014that magic runs in Arjiki bloodlines, that her grandmother taught her the old ways. It's a good lie. Convincing. Almost true, since her grandmother did teach her <em>something</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But Sarima knows the truth. Her magic isn't a gift. It's <em>bought</em>. She can feel the debt, a weight in her chest, a pull toward something she can't see.</p>\n\n<p>And sometimes\u2014not often, but <em>sometimes</em>\u2014she does things she didn't decide to do. Walks somewhere without meaning to. Says yes when she meant no. Wakes up with dirt under her nails and no memory of going outside.</p>\n\n<p>She's terrified to find out what she really traded, and what happens when it comes to collect.</p>\n\n<h3>The Blood Oath</h3>\n<p>Sarima's stated reason for being at Yackle's estate is a lie, but a plausible one: she claims Yackle swore a blood oath to her grandmother forty years ago, and in Arjiki culture, such debts pass through generations. She has no evidence of this. But it sounds like something an Arjiki would pursue, so it works as cover.</p>\n\n<p>The real reason she came: she received the invitation, and something <em>pulled</em> her here. Not a voice. Not a compulsion she could fight. Just the certainty that she <em>had to</em> be here. Like the thing she made the deal with is calling in part of the debt.</p>\n\n<p>She's terrified this is the payment coming due.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>\n\n<h3>Basic Stats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 13 (leather armor + cloak)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 32 (5d8 + 5)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative:</strong> +2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ability Scores</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>\n<tr><td>10 (+0)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>15 (+2)</td><td>18 (+4)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom +5, Charisma +7</li>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Arcana +4, Deception +7, Intimidation +7, Nature +4, Survival +5</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Arjiki, Quadling, Vinkus Trade Tongue</li>\n<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Herbalism kit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Witch Class Features (Warlock)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pact Magic:</strong> Regain all spell slots on short rest (5th level = two 3rd-level slots)</li>\n<li><strong>Eldritch Invocations (3):</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Agonizing Blast:</strong> Add Charisma modifier to <em>Eldritch Blast</em> damage</li>\n  <li><strong>Armor of Shadows:</strong> Cast <em>Mage Armor</em> on self at will (already calculated in AC)</li>\n  <li><strong>Misty Visions:</strong> Cast <em>Silent Image</em> at will</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pact of the Talisman:</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Bone medallion serves as focus</li>\n  <li>When wearer fails ability check, can add 1d4 to roll (prof bonus/day, currently 3/day)</li>\n  <li>If wearer other than Sarima dies while wearing it, Sarima knows and can teleport talisman back</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Otherworldly Patron (Undying - reflavored):</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Among the Dead:</strong> Advantage on death saves and saving throws vs. disease</li>\n  <li><strong>Defy Death:</strong> Once per long rest, when dropping to 0 HP, can drop to 1 HP instead</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p><strong>Spell Save DC:</strong> 15<br>\n<strong>Spell Attack Bonus:</strong> +7<br>\n<strong>Spell Slots:</strong> Two 3rd-level slots (regain on short rest)</p>\n\n<h4>Spells Known</h4>\n<p><strong>Cantrips (at will):</strong> Eldritch Blast (1d10 + 4 force, 120 ft., 2 beams at 5th level), Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, Prestidigitation</p>\n\n<p><strong>1st-3rd Level (cast at 3rd level):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Armor of Agathys</em> (temp HP + cold damage to attackers)</li>\n<li><em>Hex</em> (bonus 1d6 necrotic, disadvantage on ability checks)</li>\n<li><em>Hold Person</em> (paralyze humanoid)</li>\n<li><em>Counterspell</em> (interrupt enemy spells)</li>\n<li><em>Hunger of Hadar</em> (20-ft. radius difficult terrain, damage, blinding darkness)</li>\n<li><em>Fly</em> (utility/escape)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Note: As a Witch (reflavored Warlock), Sarima's spells have a transactional, bargaining flavor\u2014she's calling in pieces of the deal she made.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spear</strong> (1d6/1d8 piercing, versatile, thrown 20/60 ft.) - Traditional Arjiki weapon</li>\n<li><strong>Two daggers</strong> (1d4 piercing, finesse, light, thrown 20/60 ft.) - Backup weapons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leather Armor</strong> (AC 11 + Dex, hidden under traditional clothing)</li>\n<li><strong>Protective Cloak</strong> (part of Armor of Shadows invocation, AC 13 total)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Critical Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Bone Talisman</strong> (Pact focus): Carved from an animal bone she doesn't recognize.

Whatever the cost, he's worth it.\" She'd make the deal again. She thinks.</p>\n\n<h3>Flaws</h3>\n<p><strong>Denial and Fear:</strong> \"I won't think about what I traded. I can't.\" She's built her entire identity on being a hereditary witch because facing the truth would break her.</p>\n\n<h3>Quirks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes stares at the talisman for long moments, then snaps back to awareness</li>\n<li>Refuses to make oaths or promises\u2014gets agitated if pressed</li>\n<li>Has gaps in memory she doesn't discuss</li>\n<li>Reacts strongly (anger/fear) to suggestions she's not in control</li>\n<li>Protects her brother's name fiercely\u2014any threat to him triggers rage</li>\n<li>Sings Arjiki songs when working magic, as if the tradition makes it more hers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Guidance</h2>\n\n<h3>Speech Patterns</h3>\n<p>Sarima speaks with bold confidence, code-switching between formal Common and Arjiki phrases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"In my grandmother's time, we knew how to honor debts. This is Arjiki business.\"</li>\n<li>\"<em>K'shas</em>\u2014you think I fear your house? I've walked the Thousand Year Grasslands.\"</li>\n<li>\"My magic is <em>blood magic</em>, passed through generations. You wouldn't understand.\"</li>\n<li>\"Don't tell me what I can and can't do. I decide.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When rattled or scared, she gets louder and more aggressive\u2014it's defense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Back off. I said BACK OFF.\"</li>\n<li>\"You don't know what you're talking about!\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>In Different Rooms</h3>\n\n<h4>The Chapel (Seal of Sacrifice)</h4>\n<p>This room hits Sarima <em>hard</em>. Themes of sacrifice, giving freely, altars of offering\u2014she becomes quiet, tense. If the Seal challenge involves understanding true sacrifice vs. transaction, she might have a breakdown or breakthrough moment.</p>\n\n<h4>The Library</h4>\n<p>She searches for information about pacts, deals, magical transactions. Tries to be subtle but becomes increasingly frantic if she finds relevant texts. What did she trade? Can she get it back?</p>\n\n<h4>The Dining Room</h4>\n<p>Sarima is loud, opinionated, taking up space. She'll argue about Arjiki rights, criticize the Wizard's regime, debate theology with Sister Shell. It's all performance\u2014look how strong I am, how unafraid.</p>\n\n<h4>Any Room With Mirrors</h4>\n<p>She avoids looking too long. Sometimes her reflection feels <em>wrong</em>, like it's not quite synchronized with her movements.</p>\n\n<h4>During Combat</h4>\n<p>Sarima fights aggressively, calling on her pact magic without hesitation. <em>Eldritch Blast</em> crackling from her hands, <em>Hex</em> marking enemies, <em>Hunger of Hadar</em> summoning horrible darkness. She yells in Arjiki, channels rage and fear into power.</p>\n\n<p>If she uses <em>Defy Death</em> (survive at 1 HP), describe something <em>else</em> keeping her upright\u2014strings of shadow, a cold presence, the talisman burning hot.</p>\n\n<h3>Emotional Beats</h3>\n\n<h4>Pride</h4>\n<p>When someone respects Arjiki culture or acknowledges her strength, she lights up with genuine warmth.</p>\n\n<h4>Fear</h4>\n<p>When she does something she didn't decide to do (walking to a specific room, saying something strange), she freezes afterward, touching the talisman, looking confused and terrified.</p>\n\n<h4>Rage</h4>\n<p>Any threat to her autonomy or suggestion she's not in control triggers explosive anger. It's covering terror.</p>\n\n<h4>Guilt</h4>\n<p>Rare moments when she's alone, she might whisper, \"What did I give you? What did you take?\" to the talisman, desperate and small.</p>\n\n<h2>The Secret's Role</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Secret</h3>\n<p>The GM can create tension around Sarima's pact in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compelled Actions:</strong> Sarima walks to a specific location without deciding to. Opens a door she meant to avoid. Says something she didn't plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Gaps:</strong> She loses time\u2014minutes, hours. Comes to awareness in a different room with no memory of getting there.</li>\n<li><strong>The Talisman:</strong> It heats up near certain objects/rooms. Whispers in a language she doesn't know. Pulls toward something.</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Knowledge:</strong> Books in the library about pact magic, transactional sorcery, or entities that trade in debts. Maybe even a contract with Sarima's name.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Signs:</strong> When using powerful magic, shadows don't quite match her movements. Eyes briefly go black. Voice harmonizes with something else.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Potential Reveals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voluntary Confession:</strong> Breaking down and admitting \"I don't know what I traded. I'm so scared.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Forced by Magic:</strong> <em>Zone of Truth</em>, <em>Detect Thoughts</em>, or Yackle's direct interrogation</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Monologue:</strong> \"Tell them about the deal, Sarima. Tell them what you sold for your brother's life.\"</li>\n<li><strong>The Patron Appears:</strong> During Phase 2 or 3, whatever Sarima made the deal with might manifest, revealing she's been its agent all along</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Secret</h3>\n<p>If Sarima's secret is revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Devastating shame\u2014her entire identity as hereditary witch is false</li>\n<li>Relief\u2014finally someone knows, she's not alone with it</li>\n<li>Fear\u2014what happens now? Will it come to collect?</li>\n<li>Possibility\u2014maybe others can help her understand or break the deal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>\n\n<h3>Why She Chose Her</h3>\n<p>Yackle selected Sarima because she perfectly inverts Sacrifice\u2014the Binding that says giving freely creates value. Sarima didn't give; she <em>traded</em>. Her magic is transactional, bought with something she can't even name. She's proof that power can come from deals rather than gifts, that sacrifice can be extracted rather than offered.</p>\n\n<h3>How She'll Use Her</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects Sarima's secret, she gains power over bargains, debts, and compulsion. She might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Force Sarima to use her magic against the party (calling in the debt)</li>\n<li>Steal Sarima's spell slots, channeling the pact magic through herself</li>\n<li>Reveal what Sarima really traded: years of her life, her ability to love freely, her memories of who she was before</li>\n<li>Break Sarima's concentration on key spells at critical moments</li>\n<li>Offer Sarima a new deal: \"Betray them, and I'll tell you what you gave away.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Confrontation</h3>\n<p>When Yackle addresses Sarima directly, she might say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Such a proud hereditary witch. Tell me, when did your grandmother teach you to <em>beg</em> in the dark?\"</li>\n<li>\"You wanted to know what you traded? Your <em>choice</em>, Sarima. You gave away your ability to choose freely. Every decision since has been <em>suggested</em>.\"</li>\n<li>\"The talisman isn't yours. You're <em>its</em>. And it's been walking you here, step by step, for fourteen years.\"</li>\n<li>\"Your brother was going to live anyway. You traded everything for nothing.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Sarima</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize the contrast: fierce confidence masking deep fear</li>\n<li>Show small moments of lost control\u2014walking somewhere she didn't mean to go, saying something strange</li>\n<li>Make her genuinely knowledgeable about Arjiki culture\u2014the pride isn't fake, even if the magic's origin is</li>\n<li>Use the talisman as a prop: she touches it constantly, and you can describe it behaving oddly</li>\n<li>When the secret emerges, play both the shame and the relief</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Combat Role</h3>\n<p>Sarima is a blaster and controller:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Eldritch Blast</em> with Agonizing Blast = 2 beams \u00d7 (1d10 + 4) = avg 19 damage/round, reliable ranged damage</li>\n<li><em>Hex</em> adds 1d6 per hit and gives disadvantage on chosen ability checks (great for hindering skill monkeys)</li>\n<li><em>Hunger of Hadar</em> is devastating area control\u201420-ft. radius darkness, difficult terrain, 2d6 cold + 2d6 acid damage</li>\n<li><em>Counterspell</em> shuts down enemy casters</li>\n<li><em>Hold Person</em> paralyzes humanoids (auto-crit for melee allies)</li>\n<li>Pact Magic slots on short rest means she can nova hard, rest, and nova again</li>\n<li><em>Defy Death</em> once per long rest gives her emergency survival</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Patron Mystery</h3>\n<p>The GM can decide what Sarima's patron actually is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Yackle herself\u2014the \"something\" that answered was Yackle, and Sarima's been her agent for years without knowing</li>\n<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> A Kumbric entity\u2014something from the Void before Lurline's bindings, drawn to Sarima's desperation</li>\n<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> An intermediary\u2014something else made the deal, but the debt was sold to Yackle, who now owns Sarima's contract</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Relationships with Other Pre-Gens</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Scholar:</strong> Suspicious of his academic authority, but might ask him about magical theory. \"Is there a way to... break a pact?\"</li>\n<li><strong>The Heir:</strong> Respects his military bearing but mocks Gillikinese nobility. Arjiki and Emerald City don't mix.</li>\n<li><strong>The Animal:</strong> Doesn't realize Frederick is an Animal, but appreciates anyone else who keeps their head down around authorities.</li>\n<li><strong>The Maunt:</strong> HATES Sister Shell's Unionist background.

She appears to be a woman who peacefully left religious life to pursue a calling elsewhere. <strong>THE SECRET:</strong> She was expelled for loyalty. She didn't leave\u2014she was cast out. She discovered the mauntery was complicit in Animal purges, providing theological justification for atrocities. When she tried to expose them, they silenced her and forced her out. Her faithful service was rewarded with betrayal.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Secret:</strong> Despite being expelled and despite knowing the church's crimes, she still has faith. Her powers still work. This confuses and frightens her\u2014if the church is corrupt, why does its god still answer her prayers?</p>\n<p><strong>Service Binding Inversion:</strong> Service says duty creates meaning through bonds. Shell served faithfully and was <em>punished</em> for it. Her service created only exile.</p>\n<p><strong>If Secret Collected:</strong> Yackle has resistance to radiant damage.

She's deeply compassionate, genuinely faithful, and utterly betrayed by the institution she served for fifteen years. She still heals, still prays, still believes\u2014but she no longer knows <em>what</em> she believes in. The Unnamed God? Lurline? Something else? Her powers work regardless, which terrifies her because it suggests faith itself, not doctrine, might be what matters.</p>\n\n<p>She's gentle but not weak, kind but not naive (not anymore). She knows what the church is capable of. She's seen the theological justifications for genocide written in beautiful calligraphy by people she once called siblings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Touches her holy symbol (still wears it), then pulls her hand away guiltily</li>\n<li>Quotes Unionist scripture, then stops mid-sentence, uncertain</li>\n<li>Apologizes constantly, even when not at fault</li>\n<li>Stands with perfect mauntery posture, then catches herself and relaxes</li>\n<li>Hesitates before using divine magic, as if expecting it to fail this time</li>\n<li>Listens more than she speaks\u2014fifteen years of obedience run deep</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What She Wants:</strong> To understand why her faith still works, to find a way to serve that isn't corrupted, to know whether loyalty and goodness are compatible or if she has to choose.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> 37</li>\n<li><strong>Height/Build:</strong> 5'5\", slight build, moves with practiced quiet from years of mauntery life</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Pale Munchkinlander skin, light brown hair cut short (mauntery habit, hasn't grown it out), gray-blue eyes that have seen too much, calloused hands from service work</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Simple gray robes\u2014not quite mauntery habit, not quite civilian. She's caught between identities. Practical boots, worn cloak. Everything is mended, nothing wasted. She still dresses like someone under vows of simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing Marks:</strong> Faint scars on her knuckles from vigil-keeping (kneeling on stone floors), a brand on her left shoulder blade (mauntery mark, normally hidden) that she's considered having removed but hasn't</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>The Call</h3>\n<p>Shella Arns entered the Mauntery of St. Aelphaba in Rush Margins when she was twenty-two. Not fleeing anything, not hiding\u2014she genuinely felt called. The structure, the service, the sense of purpose: it fit her like she'd been made for it.</p>\n\n<p>She took the name Sister Shell (a traditional mauntery name, meaning \"vessel for divine will\") and spent fifteen years in faithful service. She tended the sick, educated poor children, copied sacred texts, kept vigil, prayed the hours. She was good at it. She was <em>happy</em>.</p>\n\n<p>She believed in the work. She believed in the Unnamed God. She believed that Unionism, at its best, could bring order, comfort, meaning to a chaotic world.</p>\n\n<h3>The Discovery</h3>\n<p>Three years ago, Shell was assigned to the mauntery archives\u2014cataloging historical documents, preserving records. She was honored. The archives were sacred space.</p>\n\n<p>She found correspondence between the Mother Superior and regional Gale Force commanders. Letters about \"the Animal problem.\" Theological arguments justifying the round-ups, written by senior maunt scholars. <em>\"Animals cannot possess souls, therefore forcible suppression is not sin but pest control.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>She found budgets: payments from the Wizard's regime to the mauntery for \"spiritual consultation\" on Animal policy. She found reports of maunt confessors who informed on families suspected of harboring Animals. She found a list of disappeared people.</p>\n\n<p>Her mauntery\u2014<em>her sisters</em>\u2014had been party to atrocity. For money. For power. For ideological purity.</p>\n\n<h3>The Exposure</h3>\n<p>Shell did what her faith taught her: she brought the truth to light. She went to the Mother Superior with the documents. Explained what she'd found. Suggested, respectfully, that they must acknowledge this sin and make amends.</p>\n\n<p>The Mother Superior listened. Then called two senior maunts as witness. Then told Shell she was suffering from spiritual crisis, that she'd misunderstood what she'd read, that pride and doubt were corrupting her judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Shell insisted. Showed the documents again. Said, \"These are real. We did this.\"</p>\n\n<p>They gave her a choice: recant, accept penance, and never speak of this again\u2014or leave.</p>\n\n<p>She couldn't recant. It would be a lie. So they expelled her.</p>\n\n<h3>The Exile</h3>\n<p>For two years, Shell has been adrift. She can't go to other Unionist institutions\u2014word spread that she's \"troubled,\" \"unstable,\" \"suffering spiritual sickness.\" She can't abandon her faith entirely\u2014it's woven into who she is.</p>\n\n<p>And her magic still works. <em>That's the part that breaks her.</em></p>\n\n<p>She prays to the Unnamed God, and healing flows through her hands. She calls on divine power, and it answers. If the church is corrupt, if the doctrine was used to justify murder, why does the magic still come?</p>\n\n<p>Either the Unnamed God approves of atrocity, or Shell has been wrong about where her power comes from. Both possibilities are unbearable.</p>\n\n<h3>The Invitation</h3>\n<p>Shell's stated reason for attending the will reading: she found references to Yackle in the mauntery archives\u2014records suggesting Yackle donated heavily to the order generations ago, with a stipulation that any \"true seeker\" who came asking would be welcomed to her estate.</p>\n\n<p>This is partially true. There <em>were</em> such records. But Shell came because she's desperate. If Yackle was a powerful witch who dealt with religious orders, maybe she'll have answers. Maybe she'll know what Shell should do with faith that still works despite institutional betrayal.</p>\n\n<p>Shell doesn't expect inheritance. She expects revelation.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>\n\n<h3>Basic Stats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 16 (chain mail)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 34 (5d8 + 5)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative:</strong> +0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ability Scores</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>\n<tr><td>12 (+1)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>18 (+4)</td><td>15 (+2)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom +7, Charisma +5</li>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Insight +7, Medicine +7, Persuasion +5, Religion +5</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Munchkinlander, Ancient Ozian, Celestial</li>\n<li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Unionist Class Features (Cleric)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Divine Domain:</strong> Conversion Domain\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Bonus Proficiencies:</strong> Persuasion, Performance (Shell is better at Persuasion than Performance)</li>\n  <li><strong>Compelling Presence (1st):</strong> Add Wisdom modifier to Charisma (Persuasion) checks; knows <em>Friends</em> cantrip</li>\n  <li><strong>Channel Divinity: Convert the Masses (2nd):</strong> Action, 30-ft. radius, Wisdom save or charmed for 1 hour (view Unionism favorably, inclined to listen to religious arguments)</li>\n  <li><strong>Shepherd of Souls (6th, not yet available):</strong> Would grant temp HP when healing</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Channel Divinity (1/rest, 2 options):</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Turn Heretics:</strong> Wisdom save or turned for 1 minute (affects Lurlinites, Witches, heretical spellcasters)</li>\n  <li><strong>Convert the Masses:</strong> (see above)</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Destroy Heresy (5th level):</strong> When turned heretic starts turn within 30 ft., Wisdom save or take 2d8 radiant damage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Spellcasting</h3>\n<p><strong>Spell Save DC:</strong> 15<br>\n<strong>Spell Attack Bonus:</strong> +7<br>\n<strong>Spell Slots:</strong> 1st (4), 2nd (3), 3rd (2)</p>\n\n<h4>Spells Prepared (Wis mod + level = 4 + 5 = 9 spells + domain spells always prepared)</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Cantrips (4):</strong> Friends (domain), Guidance, Light, Sacred Flame, Spare the Dying</p>\n\n<p><strong>Domain Spells (always prepared):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st: <em>Charm Person</em>, <em>Sanctuary</em></li>\n<li>2nd: <em>Calm Emotions</em>, <em>Suggestion</em></li>\n<li>3rd: <em>Beacon of Hope</em>, <em>Tongues</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Prepared Spells (chosen daily, current selection):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st Level:</strong> <em>Bless</em>, <em>Cure Wounds</em>, <em>Detect Evil and Good</em>, <em>Shield of Faith</em></li>\n<li><strong>2nd Level:</strong> <em>Aid</em>, <em>Lesser Restoration</em>, <em>Spiritual Weapon</em></li>\n<li><strong>3rd Level:</strong> <em>Dispel Magic</em>, <em>Mass Healing Word</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mace</strong> (1d6 + 1 bludgeoning) - Simple, utilitarian, still carries it from mauntery days</li>\n<li><strong>Shield</strong> (+2 AC, included in AC calculation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chain Mail</strong> (AC 16, moves quietly despite the armor\u2014years of practice)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Critical Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Holy Symbol (Unionist Eye)</strong>: Worn on a chain around her neck.

The order's seal, burned into her skin during her final vows.

She'd do it again.)</p>\n\n<h3>Bonds</h3>\n<p><strong>The Unnamed God (?):</strong> \"My faith is all I have left. I don't understand it, but I can't let go.\" She's still devoted, even as she questions everything.</p>\n\n<h3>Flaws</h3>\n<p><strong>Guilt and Compliance:</strong> \"I spent fifteen years serving an institution that enabled murder. How much am I complicit?\" She apologizes constantly, second-guesses herself, struggles to assert authority even when she's right.</p>\n\n<h3>Quirks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wakes before dawn (vigil habit she can't break)</li>\n<li>Prays the hours silently even when no one's watching</li>\n<li>Flinches when people raise their voices\u2014conflict is terrifying</li>\n<li>Extremely neat and organized (mauntery training)</li>\n<li>Offers to heal people before they ask</li>\n<li>Quotes scripture, then stops, unsure if she still believes it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Guidance</h2>\n\n<h3>Speech Patterns</h3>\n<p>Shell speaks gently, formally, with scripture woven in\u2014then catches herself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"The texts say that truth is a lantern in darkness, but... I'm not sure anymore.\"</li>\n<li>\"I'm sorry\u2014I shouldn't presume\u2014but might I offer healing?\"</li>\n<li>\"In the mauntery, we believed... well. I don't know what I believe now.\"</li>\n<li>\"Please, let's not fight. There must be a peaceful solution.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When stressed or desperate, scripture pours out automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"By the Unnamed's will, be at peace!\"</li>\n<li>\"In unity there is strength, in strength there is order\u2014\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>In Different Rooms</h3>\n\n<h4>The Chapel (Seal of Sacrifice)</h4>\n<p>This room could break Shell or heal her. If the chapel is corrupted, abandoned, or reveals Unionist hypocrisy, she might shatter. If it contains genuine holiness or asks her to confront what true sacrifice means, she might find clarity.</p>\n\n<h4>The Library</h4>\n<p>Shell searches for theological texts, histories of Unionism, anything about the Unnamed God vs. Lurline. She needs to understand why her powers still work. If she finds books proving the church's long history of atrocity, she'll read them with tears streaming down her face.</p>\n\n<h4>The Servant Quarters / Memorial Room (Seal of Service)</h4>\n<p>If the Seal of Service asks her to understand what faithful service truly means\u2014or confronts her with the servants who were exploited/killed by Yackle\u2014this could be her pivotal moment. Service that creates bonds vs. service that enables evil.</p>\n\n<h4>The Dining Room</h4>\n<p>Shell is polite, gentle, tries to keep peace. If Sarima attacks Unionism, Shell doesn't defend the institution\u2014she might even agree\u2014but defends her personal faith quietly. She's exhausted by conflict.</p>\n\n<h4>During Combat</h4>\n<p>Shell fights reluctantly but effectively. She's support/healer first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bless</em> on allies before battle</li>\n<li><em>Cure Wounds</em> / <em>Mass Healing Word</em> to keep party alive</li>\n<li><em>Spiritual Weapon</em> (manifests as a glowing mace) for damage without risk</li>\n<li><em>Sacred Flame</em> for ranged attacks when healing isn't needed</li>\n<li>Uses <em>Shield of Faith</em> on frontliners</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every time she uses divine magic, describe it working\u2014light, warmth, healing\u2014and her brief moment of relief/confusion that it still answers.</p>\n\n<h3>Emotional Beats</h3>\n\n<h4>Faith Crisis</h4>\n<p>When confronted with religious questions, she becomes very quiet, very still. \"I don't know anymore. I don't know.\"</p>\n\n<h4>Healing</h4>\n<p>When she heals someone, there's genuine joy\u2014this is what faith should be, helping people. It's the one thing she's sure of.</p>\n\n<h4>Injustice</h4>\n<p>If she witnesses cruelty or oppression, something hardens in her. She'll step forward, gentle voice firm: \"No. This is wrong.\"</p>\n\n<h4>Validation</h4>\n<p>If someone tells her she did the right thing by exposing the mauntery, she might cry\u2014she's had no one affirm that choice in two years.</p>\n\n<h2>The Secret's Role</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Secret</h3>\n<p>The GM can create tension around Shell's expulsion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Library:</strong> Books about mauntery history, records of collaboration with the regime, theological arguments for Animal persecution</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Knowledge:</strong> She might have firsthand knowledge of Unionist corruption, or even correspondence with Shell's Mother Superior</li>\n<li><strong>Animal Encounters:</strong> If the party includes Frederick (the Fox), Shell must decide whether her faith allows for Animal consciousness\u2014her old church said no</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Evidence:</strong> If her mauntery brand is revealed (injury exposes her shoulder), others might ask what it means</li>\n<li><strong>Magic Crisis:</strong> A moment where Shell tries to use divine magic and, for the first time, it fails. Her faith crisis becomes literal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Potential Reveals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voluntary Confession:</strong> \"I need you to know why I left. I need someone to know it wasn't cowardice.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Forced Discovery:</strong> Someone finds the documents in her pack</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Monologue:</strong> \"Tell them about the mauntery, Sister Shell. Tell them what faithful service earned you.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Confrontation with Sarima:</strong> If the Arjiki woman attacks Unionism, Shell might break and confess, \"You're right. You're right about all of it.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Secret</h3>\n<p>If Shell's secret is revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overwhelming relief\u2014finally, someone knows the truth</li>\n<li>Shame\u2014she should have done more, sooner</li>\n<li>Validation\u2014if the party supports her decision</li>\n<li>Renewed purpose\u2014maybe she can serve in a way that matters now</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>\n\n<h3>Why She Chose Her</h3>\n<p>Yackle selected Shell because she perfectly inverts Service\u2014the Binding that says duty creates meaning through bonds. Shell served faithfully for fifteen years and was betrayed by her order. Her service created no meaning, no bonds, only exile. She's proof that duty can be corrupted, that loyalty can be punished, that service to an institution doesn't guarantee reciprocal care.</p>\n\n<h3>How She'll Use Her</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects Shell's secret, she gains power over faith, healing, and divine magic. She might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain resistance to radiant damage (holy power can't fully harm her)</li>\n<li>Corrupt Shell's healing\u2014making her spells heal Yackle instead of or in addition to allies</li>\n<li>Force Shell to witness Animals being tortured, making her complicit again</li>\n<li>Make Shell choose: heal Yackle to save an ally's life, or let the ally die</li>\n<li>Reveal that Shell's powers come from Lurline, not the Unnamed God, shattering her remaining faith</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Confrontation</h3>\n<p>When Yackle addresses Shell directly, she might say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Such faithful service, Sister. Did your order thank you before they cast you out?\"</li>\n<li>\"You still pray to the Unnamed God. Tell me\u2014why does She answer a heretic?\"</li>\n<li>\"Your church provided the theology for genocide. And you still wear their symbol. Explain that to me.\"</li>\n<li>\"You think you're different from them? You wore their robes, spoke their prayers, took their communion for fifteen years. You <em>were</em> them.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Shell</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize her gentleness\u2014she's genuinely kind, not performatively</li>\n<li>Show the contradiction: faithful but faithless, expelled but still devout</li>\n<li>Make her crisis relatable\u2014what do you do when your institution betrays its ideals?</li>\n<li>Every use of divine magic should have a moment of \"it still works, why does it still work?\"</li>\n<li>Let her be competent in combat despite her doubts\u2014healing is muscle memory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Combat Role</h3>\n<p>Shell is primary healer and support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bless</em> gives +1d4 to attacks/saves for 3 allies (entire combat)</li>\n<li><em>Cure Wounds</em> heals 1d8 + 4 (avg 8.5 per 1st-level slot)</li>\n<li><em>Mass Healing Word</em> heals up to 6 allies for 1d4 + 4 (bonus action, lifesaver)</li>\n<li><em>Spiritual Weapon</em> gives bonus action attacks for 1d8 + 4 damage (no concentration)</li>\n<li><em>Aid</em> increases max HP by 5 for 3 allies for 8 hours</li>\n<li><em>Beacon of Hope</em> gives advantage on Wisdom saves and max healing</li>\n<li><em>Shield of Faith</em> grants +2 AC to tank</li>\n<li>Channel Divinity: Convert the Masses can charm entire enemy groups</li>\n<li>She can wear heavy armor and use a shield\u2014surprisingly durable for a healer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Faith Questions</h3>\n<p>The GM can use Shell to explore theological questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where does divine magic really come from\u2014the god, the institution, or the faith itself?</li>\n<li>Can you be faithful to ideals while rejecting the institution?</li>\n<li>Is complicity through inaction different from active participation?</li>\n<li>What does it mean if gods answer prayers from the \"wrong\" people?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Relationships with Other Pre-Gens</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Scholar:</strong> Appreciates Averic's dedication to truth and documentation. Might ask him to help verify the documents she carries.</li>\n<li><strong>The Heir:</strong> Treats Liir with gentle respect, doesn't care about his bloodline\u2014service matters, not lineage.</li>\n<li><strong>The Animal:</strong> If Frederick is revealed, Shell faces a crisis\u2014her church says Animals have no souls, but she can SEE his consciousness, his fear, his personhood. Which is true?</li>\n<li><strong>The Debt-Holder:</strong> Tense relationship. Sarima hates Unionists for what they did to her people. Shell agrees with every criticism but can't abandon her faith.</li>\n<li><strong>The Widow:</strong> Madame Viridian asks theological questions that unsettle Shell. \"Why does your god still answer, Sister?\"</li>\n<li><strong>The Veteran:</strong> Sees Captain Trynn's guilt and wants to offer absolution, but worries she has no authority to grant it.</li>\n<li><strong>The Tiktok:</strong> Deeply curious about Seven's consciousness. If a construct can think and feel, what makes a soul?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Wiki Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/munchkinlander', 'Munchkinlander'); return false;\">Munchkinlander</a> - Shell's people</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-unionist', 'The Unionist'); return false;\">The Unionist</a> - Shell's class</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/acolyte', 'Acolyte'); return false;\">Acolyte Background</a> - Religious service</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('religion/unionism', 'Unionism'); return false;\">Unionism</a> - The faith Shell questions</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/mauntery-of-st-aelphaba', 'Mauntery of St. Aelphaba'); return false;\">Mauntery of St. Aelphaba</a> - Shell's former home</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> - Service and its inversion</li>\n</ul>",

She knows courtly etiquette, can navigate aristocratic social situations, and has (claimed) connections to noble houses. This is partially fabricated\u2014Yackle has been many things over centuries, including actual nobility on several occasions.</p>\n\n<h2>The Widow's Cover Story</h2>\n\n<p><strong>What The Widow Claims:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Born Viridian Chuffrey, married Lord Marcus Viridian at age 20</li>\n<li>Served in the palace at <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/emerald-city', 'Emerald City'); return false;\">Emerald City</a> for several years</li>\n<li>Husband died in a riding accident three years ago (tragic, unexpected, she doesn't like to talk about it)</li>\n<li>Yackle was her husband's great-aunt (or possibly great-great-aunt, the family tree is complicated)</li>\n<li>She met Yackle once, briefly, at her wedding\u2014an ancient woman who gave her a crystal pendant and cryptic advice</li>\n<li>The inheritance letter surprised her; she didn't think Yackle even remembered her</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Truth:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All of this is false</li>\n<li>The Widow is a construct\u2014a persona Yackle created for this specific purpose</li>\n<li>The crystal pendant is the anchor for her <em>disguise self</em> magic (far more powerful than the standard spell)</li>\n<li>Every memory, every mannerism, every tear shed for the \"late Lord Viridian\" is performance</li>\n<li>Yackle is testing the other heirs by living among them, watching them solve her puzzles, evaluating them as potential vessels or sacrifices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Personality (As Roleplayed)</h2>\n\n<h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I notice things others miss\u2014a misplaced book, a nervous glance, a lie poorly told</li>\n<li>I speak in metaphors and oblique references; grief has made me poetic in an irritating way</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ideal</h3>\n<p><strong>Knowledge.</strong> Understanding the truth is more important than comfort or kindness. (Neutral)</p>\n\n<h3>Bond</h3>\n<p>I wear my husband's memory like armor. No one gets close enough to hurt me again. (This is a lie\u2014there was no husband\u2014but she plays it convincingly.)</p>\n\n<h3>Flaw</h3>\n<p>I assume I'm the cleverest person in any room, and I'm usually right. (This is actually true.)</p>\n\n<h2>Backstory (Cover Story)</h2>\n\n<p>Madame Viridian's story is one of love and loss, elegance and sorrow. She married well, lived well, and lost everything when her husband died. She threw herself into study afterward\u2014magic, history, divination\u2014anything to make sense of a senseless tragedy. She became known in certain circles as a talented diviner, someone who could find lost things and foresee dangers.</p>\n\n<p>When the inheritance letter arrived, she saw it as fate. Perhaps Yackle's estate held answers. Perhaps it held closure. Perhaps it was simply time to stop hiding in libraries and rejoin the world.</p>\n\n<p>(None of this happened. Yackle created this entire narrative and can recite it flawlessly because she's had centuries of practice being other people.)</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying The Widow</h2>\n\n<div class=\"gm-warning\">\n<p><strong>For the Player:</strong> Play The Widow as a intelligent, melancholic woman with uncanny insight. You're not trying to deceive the party (in-character)\u2014you're the perceptive one who notices clues and asks pointed questions. Lean into the Divination wizard archetype: you see things coming, you know more than you should, you're always one step ahead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the GM:</strong> Watch for moments where The Widow's knowledge seems suspiciously accurate. That's Yackle's centuries of experience leaking through. Plant seeds early: she knows which rooms are dangerous, she recognizes magical effects she shouldn't, she's oddly calm about horrors that should terrify her. When players notice, don't confirm\u2014just smile mysteriously.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Mannerisms</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Touches her crystal pendant when thinking (it's her disguise anchor\u2014checking it's secure)</li>\n<li>Tilts head slightly when listening, like a bird (ancient habit, predates this persona)</li>\n<li>Smiles sadly at things that aren't sad (because she knows how the story ends)</li>\n<li>Speaks in soft, measured tones\u2014except when excited about magic, then becomes animated</li>\n<li>Uses her Portent rolls at dramatically perfect moments (because she's literally orchestrating events)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Voice and Speech</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Educated Gillikinese accent, aristocratic but not haughty</li>\n<li>References obscure historical events or magical theories casually</li>\n<li>Uses phrases like \"I foresaw this,\" \"As I suspected,\" \"Curious, isn't it?\"</li>\n<li>When revealing information: \"I've seen something like this before, long ago...\" (literally true)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Red Flags (Things Perceptive Players Might Notice)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>She knows the layout of the manor suspiciously well (\"I have a good sense of direction\")</li>\n<li>She recognizes magical items without casting <em>identify</em> (\"I've read about such things\")</li>\n<li>She's never actually frightened\u2014curious, concerned, cautious, but never afraid</li>\n<li>When \"Yackle\" is mentioned, she shows interest but not surprise</li>\n<li>Her Portent rolls seem to benefit her goals specifically (because they do)</li>\n<li>She sometimes refers to past events she \"shouldn't\" know: \"The last time someone tried to bind this manor...\" (Last time? How do you know there was a last time?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics (While Disguised)</h2>\n\n<h3>The Widow Fights to Survive</h3>\n<p>While maintaining her disguise, The Widow fights like a cautious, intelligent wizard who wants to live through this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Cast <em>mage armor</em> before danger (AC 15)</li>\n<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Use <em>shield</em> reaction when hit (+5 AC)</li>\n<li><strong>Control:</strong> She has no direct damage spells prepared\u2014she focuses on information gathering and utility</li>\n<li><strong>Portent:</strong> Use Portent rolls to make enemies fail saves or miss attacks. Also use to ensure allies succeed on critical rolls (maintaining the disguise requires being helpful)</li>\n<li><strong>Escape:</strong> <em>Misty step</em> to teleport away from threats</li>\n<li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Use <em>detect thoughts</em> to read enemy intentions, <em>dispel magic</em> to counter magical threats</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Limitations While Disguised</h3>\n<p>Yackle is deliberately limiting herself to 5th-level wizard abilities to maintain the cover. She won't reveal her true power until the dramatic moment. If the party faces overwhelming danger, she might subtly help\u2014using Portent to save someone at a critical moment\u2014but she won't blow her cover.</p>\n\n<h3>When The Disguise Drops</h3>\n<p>Once revealed, Yackle stops holding back. Refer to the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle NPC'); return false;\">Yackle NPC page</a> for her true stats (CR 10 spellcaster with legendary resistances and much higher-level spells).</p>\n\n<h2>The Reveal</h2>\n\n<div class=\"gm-warning\">\n<p><strong>Orchestrating the Dramatic Reveal:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: The False Yackle</strong><br>\nThe party confronts \"Yackle\" in her study (actually a magical duplicate or illusion). They fight, they win, \"Yackle\" dies. Then The Widow speaks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Did you truly believe an immortal witch would be so easy to kill? I've been walking beside you since you arrived. Learning you. Measuring you. And now...\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The crystal pendant shatters. The disguise dissolves. The Widow's form shifts, ages, transforms into the ancient witch Yackle. Roll initiative for Phase 2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: The Willing Confession</strong><br>\nIf the party is clever and directly accuses The Widow (maybe they cast <em>detect magic</em> on her pendant, or pieced together the clues), Yackle might drop the act herself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Well done. I was wondering if any of you would see through it. Yes, I am Yackle. I have been from the beginning. And now that you know... what will you do about it?\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Option 3: The Tragic Necessity</strong><br>\nIf another heir is about to die, Yackle might reveal herself to save them\u2014not out of kindness, but because she needs them for the ritual:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"No. You don't die yet. I haven't finished with you.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then she unleashes her true power to eliminate the threat, disguise be damned.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Playing The Widow: GM Guidance</h2>\n\n<h3>Before the Reveal</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be Helpful:</strong> The Widow should be genuinely useful. Use <em>detect magic</em> to find traps, <em>identify</em> to analyze items, Portent to save allies. This builds trust.</li>\n<li><strong>Be Knowing:</strong> Drop hints that she knows more than she should. Frame it as divination magic: \"I saw this in a dream,\" \"The cards foretold...\"</li>\n<li><strong>Be Mysterious:</strong> Deflect personal questions. She's a widow, she's grieving, she's private. People accept this.</li>\n<li><strong>Be Competent:</strong> She's the smart one. She solves puzzles, notices clues, reads people. This is Yackle's centuries of experience shining through.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Clues to Plant</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>She never gets lost in the manor</li>\n<li>She knows which books in the library are important</li>\n<li>She's not surprised by any of the house's tricks or traps</li>\n<li>She speaks about Yackle with familiarity: \"She was always theatrical\"</li>\n<li>If someone casts <em>detect magic</em> near her, the crystal pendant glows (faintly\u2014it's a \"family heirloom\" and \"slightly magical\")</li>\n<li>She sometimes slips and uses first person: \"When I\u2014when Yackle\u2014when this manor was built...\" (catches herself quickly)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Reveal</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The player can hand the character sheet to the GM</li>\n<li>Or, if the player is excited about it, let them play Yackle as the villain (this is amazing when it works)</li>\n<li>Yackle should monologue briefly\u2014she's been wearing a mask for hours/days, now she can finally speak freely</li>\n<li>Then Phase 2 combat begins</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Character Development (If Somehow She Survives As An Ally)</h2>\n\n<p>In the unlikely event that the party defeats Yackle's Phase 3 and she surrenders, or if they convince her to abandon the ritual, The Widow persona could become a mask Yackle wears to interact with the world more gently. Perhaps centuries of cruelty have exhausted her. Perhaps she's curious what it would be like to actually be the person she pretended to be.</p>\n\n<p>This is unlikely, but it's a possible redemption arc for groups that want that kind of narrative.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Why This Works</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Players trust their party.</strong> If The Widow is helpful and competent from session one, they won't suspect.</li>\n<li><strong>Divination explains everything.</strong> She knows things because she's a divination wizard. It's her class feature.</li>\n<li><strong>The twist is earned.</strong> If you plant clues, perceptive players can figure it out before the reveal. If they don't, the reveal is shocking but makes sense in hindsight.</li>\n<li><strong>It's dramatic.</strong> \"You were the villain all along\" is a classic twist, and it works here because The Widow has been genuinely helpful\u2014Yackle needed the party to get this far.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Handling the Player</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Before the game:</strong> Tell the player privately that The Widow has a secret that will be revealed during the adventure. Don't tell them what it is unless you trust them completely not to meta-game.</li>\n<li><strong>OR:</strong> Tell them upfront that The Widow is Yackle. Some players love being the secret villain and will ham it up beautifully.</li>\n<li><strong>OR:</strong> Don't tell them at all, and let the reveal shock them along with everyone else. Then offer them the choice to keep playing Yackle or switch to a backup character/NPC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What If They Figure It Out Early?</h3>\n<p>Perfect! If the party confronts The Widow before the planned reveal, let it happen. Yackle respects cleverness. She might applaud them, drop the disguise, and begin Phase 2 immediately. Or she might deny it convincingly (Deception +8 at minimum with Yackle's true stats) and let them doubt themselves. Either way, the tension increases.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese</a> - Apparent race</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;\">The Adept</a> - Apparent class</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/palace-servant', 'Palace Servant'); return false;\">Palace Servant</a> - Cover story background</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle (True Stats)</a> - Her real stat block</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate</a> - Her actual home</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake</a> - Adventure overview</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<div class=\"gm-warning\">\n<p><strong>Final GM Reminder:</strong> This character sheet should be given to one player like any other pre-gen.

Let them figure it out\u2014or let them be shocked. Either way, it'll be memorable.</p>\n</div>",

He appears to be a decorated military officer haunted by the normal horrors of war. <strong>THE SECRET:</strong> He ordered a massacre. During the Quadling campaigns, he commanded his unit to kill everyone in a village\u2014not combatants, but farmers, elders, children. The official report said \"resistance fighters.\" He told himself he was following orders, but he wasn't\u2014he was following the <em>implication</em> of orders, doing what he knew command wanted without them saying it.</p>\n<p>The deed should have transformed him into a monster. It didn't. He looks the same as before. He kept serving, kept getting promoted, kept being \"Captain Trynn, decorated officer.\" The atrocity didn't change him, and that impossibility is what breaks the Binding.</p>\n<p><strong>Deed Binding Inversion:</strong> Deed says actions shape the actor. Mareth committed atrocity and remained, outwardly, unchanged. His deed <em>didn't</em> define him\u2014an impossibility.</p>\n<p><strong>If Secret Collected:</strong> Mareth has disadvantage on attacks against Yackle. If he crits her, it becomes a normal hit instead.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Character Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Captain Mareth Trynn<br>\n<strong>Race:</strong> Gillikinese Human<br>\n<strong>Class:</strong> Soldier 5 (Champion)<br>\n<strong>Background:</strong> Soldier (Officer)<br>\n<strong>Alignment:</strong> Lawful Neutral (was Lawful Good, or thought he was)</p>\n\n<h2>Personality Summary</h2>\n<p>Mareth carries himself like a man made of duty and discipline. Thirty years of military service have given him perfect posture, calm authority, and the ability to make decisions under pressure. He's reliable, protective, competent\u2014everything you want in a veteran officer.</p>\n\n<p>He's also hollow. The man who ordered the village massacre and the man who stands here now are, somehow, the same person. No horns grew. No mark appeared. He didn't become a monster; he just <em>is</em> one, wearing the same face. He's been waiting years for the transformation that never came, for the outside to match the inside.</p>\n\n<p>He's kind because he thinks maybe kindness now will balance the scales. He protects others because he failed to protect them before. He follows orders precisely because once, he followed the <em>spirit</em> of orders and murdered children.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stands at parade rest unconsciously</li>\n<li>Speaks in crisp, clear sentences\u2014military briefing style</li>\n<li>Calls people by title or rank, rarely first names</li>\n<li>Sleeps fully clothed, ready to move</li>\n<li>Checks perimeters compulsively, always tactically aware</li>\n<li>Flinches at the smell of burning (the village burned for days)</li>\n<li>Never gives vague orders\u2014everything is precise, because vague orders led to horror</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What He Wants:</strong> To be punished, to be changed, to become the monster he knows he is so at least the world makes sense again. Or, failing that, to die protecting someone who deserves protection.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> 53</li>\n<li><strong>Height/Build:</strong> 6'2\", broad-shouldered, still fit despite age, moves with military precision</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Weathered Gillikinese features, gray hair kept military-short, steel-gray eyes that have seen too much, numerous small scars from decades of service, close-cropped beard going white at the edges</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Retired Gale Force officer's traveling coat (green-gray, well-maintained), practical trousers and boots, everything clean and orderly. Doesn't wear his medals anymore but keeps them in his pack.</li>\n<li><strong>Distinguishing Marks:</strong> Burn scar on his left forearm (from the village fires), military bearing so ingrained it's unconscious, hands that don't quite shake but want to</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>The Soldier</h3>\n<p>Mareth Trynn joined the Gale Force at nineteen\u2014Gillikinese patriotism, family tradition, genuine belief in serving Oz. He was good at it. Disciplined, brave, tactically sound. Rose through ranks: corporal, sergeant, lieutenant, captain.</p>\n\n<p>For twenty-eight years, he served honorably. He protected trade routes, quelled banditry, evacuated civilians during floods. He was proud of his work. He believed in order, law, the Wizard's vision of a unified Oz.</p>\n\n<p>He was a good man. Or thought he was.</p>\n\n<h3>The Quadling Campaigns</h3>\n<p>Fifteen years ago, Mareth's unit was deployed to the Quadling territory during the \"pacification campaigns\"\u2014putting down resistance to Emerald City rule. It was dirty work. Guerrilla fighters who melted into civilian populations. Command wanted results, wanted submission, wanted the Quadlings broken.</p>\n\n<p>Mareth's orders were to \"secure the region\" and \"neutralize resistance elements.\" Not explicit massacre orders. But he knew what command wanted. Officers who were too gentle got reassigned. Officers who got results got promoted.</p>\n\n<p>When his unit entered the village of Red Clay Fork, they found farmers. Women. Elders. Children. No weapons caches. No fighters. Just people who'd fed resistance members passing through.</p>\n\n<p>Mareth made a decision.</p>\n\n<h3>Red Clay Fork</h3>\n<p>He told himself it was strategic. These people aided the enemy. Leaving them alive sent a message of weakness. Command <em>wanted</em> this, even if they didn't say it. He was doing his duty.</p>\n\n<p>He gave the order.</p>\n\n<p>His soldiers killed everyone in Red Clay Fork. One hundred and forty-three people. They burned the village to hide evidence. The official report said \"resistance stronghold neutralized, forty-seven combatants eliminated, acceptable collateral damage.\"</p>\n\n<p>Mareth expected... something. Transformation. Damnation. A mark. Nightmares, at least. Instead, he got a commendation. A promotion to captain. Reassignment to a comfortable post in Gillikin.</p>\n\n<p>He kept serving. Kept looking the same. Kept being respected, saluted, honored.</p>\n\n<p>The deed that should have made him a monster didn't change him at all. And <em>that's</em> what broke him.</p>\n\n<h3>The Retirement</h3>\n<p>Two years ago, Mareth retired at fifty-one\u2014early, but with full honors. Thirty years of distinguished service. Pension. Medals. Respect.</p>\n\n<p>He's spent those two years waiting. For the other shoe to drop. For punishment. For transformation into the thing he knows he became at Red Clay Fork. It never comes. He's still just... Mareth Trynn, decorated veteran, helpful neighbor, man who holds doors for strangers.</p>\n\n<p>He volunteers at charity houses. Helps people. Tries to be kind. It doesn't balance. It can't. But he doesn't know what else to do.</p>\n\n<h3>The Invitation</h3>\n<p>Mareth's stated reason for attending: he claims he was once assigned to investigate Yackle's estate during the Wizard's reign. During that time, she gave him something\u2014a token, a promise\u2014and told him he would know when to use it. Now seems like that time.</p>\n\n<p>This is partially fabricated. He <em>was</em> near Yackle's estate once, during the campaigns, but he never met her.</p>\n\n<p>The truth: When the invitation arrived, it felt like the punishment he's been waiting for. A reckoning. He came because he <em>wants</em> to be judged. Wants someone to see what he did and finally, finally, treat him like the monster he is.</p>\n\n<p>He came to be destroyed. He hopes Yackle can do what Red Clay Fork couldn't\u2014change him into what his deeds should have made him.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>\n\n<h3>Basic Stats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 18 (chain mail + shield)</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 47 (5d10 + 10)</li>\n<li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft.</li>\n<li><strong>Initiative:</strong> +1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Ability Scores</h3>\n<table>\n<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>\n<tr><td>18 (+4)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>15 (+2)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>10 (+0)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength +7, Constitution +5</li>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics +7, Intimidation +3, Perception +5, Survival +5</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Gillikinese, Quadling</li>\n<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Land vehicles, playing cards (officer's pastime)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Soldier Class Features (Fighter)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fighting Style:</strong> Protection\n  <ul>\n  <li>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you within 5 ft., you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (requires shield)</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Second Wind:</strong> Bonus action, regain 1d10 + 5 HP (once per short rest)</li>\n<li><strong>Action Surge:</strong> Take additional action on your turn (once per short rest, twice at 17th level)</li>\n<li><strong>Martial Archetype: Champion</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Improved Critical (3rd):</strong> Critical hits on 19-20</li>\n  <li><strong>Remarkable Athlete (7th, not yet):</strong> Would add half proficiency to Str/Dex/Con checks</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Extra Attack:</strong> Attack twice when you take the Attack action</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n\n<h3>Weapons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Longsword</strong> (1d8 + 4 slashing, or 1d10 + 4 versatile) - Standard Gale Force officer's blade, well-maintained</li>\n<li><strong>Shield</strong> (+2 AC, included in AC calculation) - Dented from years of use</li>\n<li><strong>Handaxe \u00d7 2</strong> (1d6 + 4 slashing, light, thrown 20/60 ft.) - Backup weapons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chain Mail</strong> (AC 16) - Retired Gale Force issue, keeps it polished out of habit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Critical Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Officer's Insignia</strong>: Captain's rank pins, no longer worn but kept in his pack.

Everyone else, stay behind me.\"</li>\n<li>\"That's an order\u2014\" [catches himself] \"\u2014a suggestion. Your call.\"</li>\n<li>\"I've seen worse. We'll handle this.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When his guilt surfaces, his speech breaks down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I... I can't. Don't ask me to decide that.\"</li>\n<li>\"You don't understand. I'm not the person you think I am.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>In Different Rooms</h3>\n\n<h4>The Hall of Mirrors (Seal of Deed)</h4>\n<p>This room could shatter Mareth. If mirrors show the truth of one's deeds, he might see Red Clay Fork reflected endlessly\u2014the burning village, the faces, the smoke. The Seal challenge might ask him to acknowledge what he's done and accept that the deed <em>did</em> change him, just not visibly.</p>\n\n<h4>The Cemetery</h4>\n<p>If there are graves here\u2014especially unmarked ones, forgotten dead\u2014Mareth spends time there. Might try to tend them. Sees Red Clay Fork's victims in every unnamed stone.</p>\n\n<h4>Guest Rooms (Nightmare Scenario)</h4>\n<p>If Mareth is assigned Guest Room 2 and experiences nightmares, they'll be of Red Clay Fork. He might wake screaming or find himself standing in a room that looks like the burned village.</p>\n\n<h4>The Dining Room</h4>\n<p>Mareth is quiet, watchful. He sits where he can see all entrances. Eats efficiently. Might offer tactical advice if asked but doesn't volunteer it. He's hyper-aware of group dynamics\u2014who's vulnerable, who's strong, who needs protection.</p>\n\n<h4>During Combat</h4>\n<p>Mareth fights like a professional with a death wish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Puts himself between enemies and allies constantly</li>\n<li>Uses Protection fighting style to impose disadvantage on attacks against others</li>\n<li>Takes hits meant for others\u2014high AC and HP make him durable</li>\n<li>Gives clear tactical commands: \"Flank left, I'll hold center!\"</li>\n<li>Uses Action Surge to make devastating attacks when protecting someone</li>\n<li>Doesn't retreat, even when tactically sound\u2014he's not afraid of dying</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Emotional Beats</h3>\n\n<h4>Protectiveness</h4>\n<p>When someone is threatened, Mareth moves without thinking\u2014body between them and danger, shield up. It's instinct and penance.</p>\n\n<h4>Guilt</h4>\n<p>When alone or confronted with innocents, he becomes very quiet. Might touch the Red Clay Fork stone. Looks older.</p>\n\n<h4>Anger</h4>\n<p>Rare, but if he sees atrocity or cruelty in progress, cold rage: \"No. Not again. Not while I'm here.\"</p>\n\n<h4>Confession</h4>\n<p>If Mareth confesses Red Clay Fork to another character, he speaks in flat, military report style\u2014detached, factual, because emotion makes it impossible to say.</p>\n\n<h2>The Secret's Role</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Secret</h3>\n<p>The GM can create tension around Mareth's past:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quadling Connections:</strong> References to the Quadling campaigns, maps of the region, mentions of \"pacification operations\"</li>\n<li><strong>The Library:</strong> Military reports, campaign logs, maybe even documents about Red Clay Fork</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Knowledge:</strong> She might have records of the massacre, witnesses' testimony, or even the names of the dead</li>\n<li><strong>Moral Choices:</strong> Situations where Mareth must give orders that could lead to harm\u2014he freezes, unable to decide</li>\n<li><strong>Mirror Scenes:</strong> His reflection shows something different\u2014a younger man covered in ash and blood</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Potential Reveals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voluntary Confession:</strong> \"I need to tell you what I did. I need someone to know.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Forced by Evidence:</strong> The party finds military documents in the library listing Red Clay Fork, Captain M. Trynn commanding officer</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Monologue:</strong> \"Tell them about Red Clay Fork, Captain. How many children did you count before you stopped counting?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Breakdown Under Pressure:</strong> In a moment of crisis, he refuses to lead: \"I can't! Everyone I lead dies!\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Secret</h3>\n<p>If Mareth's secret is revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relief\u2014finally, someone knows, finally he's seen as what he is</li>\n<li>Terror\u2014will they reject him, kill him, abandon him?</li>\n<li>Waiting for the response\u2014this is the judgment he's sought</li>\n<li>If they forgive him or show compassion, he might break completely\u2014he doesn't know how to process mercy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>\n\n<h3>Why She Chose Him</h3>\n<p>Yackle selected Mareth because he perfectly inverts Deed\u2014the Binding that says actions shape the actor. Mareth committed an atrocity that should have transformed him into a monster. It didn't. He remained, outwardly and inwardly, the same capable officer. The deed that should have defined him left him unchanged, an impossibility under the Binding's rules.</p>\n\n<h3>How She'll Use Him</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects Mareth's secret, she gains power over consequences, transformation, and the weight of actions. She might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make Mareth's attacks against her fail\u2014his deeds don't matter, why should this one?</li>\n<li>Turn his critical hits into normal hits\u2014he doesn't get to be the hero</li>\n<li>Show him Red Clay Fork endlessly, forcing him to watch what he did on repeat</li>\n<li>Offer him transformation: \"You want to be a monster? I can make you one.\"</li>\n<li>Summon the dead of Red Clay Fork to fight him</li>\n<li>Strip away his competence, making him fail at the one thing he's good at (protecting others)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Confrontation</h3>\n<p>When Yackle addresses Mareth directly, she might say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"You came here to be punished, Captain. How very convenient. I accept your offering.\"</li>\n<li>\"One hundred and forty-three people, Mareth Trynn. I'll give you what you want\u2014say their names first.\"</li>\n<li>\"You think you should be a monster? You've been one for fifteen years. You just look so... normal.\"</li>\n<li>\"The children burned the longest. Did you know that? You waited three days to make sure the fires were out.\"</li>\n<li>\"You want transformation? Your deed already changed you. You just can't see it because you're looking at the wrong reflection.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Mareth</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize the contradiction: competent, protective, guilty, self-destructive</li>\n<li>Show his tactical skill\u2014he's genuinely good at keeping people alive (now)</li>\n<li>Make his protectiveness physical\u2014he puts his body on the line constantly</li>\n<li>Play the hollowness\u2014he's going through motions, waiting for judgment</li>\n<li>When the secret emerges, play his desperate hope that they'll finally reject him</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Combat Role</h3>\n<p>Mareth is a tank and protector:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AC 18 with shield makes him hard to hit</li>\n<li>47 HP is highest in the party\u2014he can absorb punishment</li>\n<li>Protection fighting style lets him impose disadvantage on attacks against allies (reaction)</li>\n<li>Extra Attack = 2 \u00d7 (1d8 + 4) = avg 17 damage/round with longsword</li>\n<li>Improved Critical (19-20) increases crit chance significantly</li>\n<li>Action Surge lets him nova\u20144 attacks in one turn</li>\n<li>Second Wind gives emergency healing (1d10 + 5, avg 10.5 HP)</li>\n<li>He should be in front, taking hits, using his reaction to protect squishies</li>\n<li>Plays recklessly\u2014tactically sound but doesn't value his own survival</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Redemption vs. Destruction</h3>\n<p>The GM can decide Mareth's arc:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redemption:</strong> He learns that deeds <em>did</em> change him\u2014he became this protective person <em>because</em> of Red Clay Fork, and that's a form of transformation</li>\n<li><strong>Sacrifice:</strong> He dies protecting the party, finally achieving the meaningful death he sought</li>\n<li><strong>Continuation:</strong> He survives and must live with both the massacre and being forgiven\u2014harder than dying</li>\n<li><strong>Transformation:</strong> Yackle offers to make him literally monstrous, and he must choose whether visible monstrosity is better than invisible guilt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Relationships with Other Pre-Gens</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Scholar:</strong> Respects Averic's knowledge, appreciates someone who thinks before acting (unlike Mareth at Red Clay Fork).</li>\n<li><strong>The Heir:</strong> Soldier recognizes soldier. Might mentor Liir in tactics, protective of his youth.</li>\n<li><strong>The Animal:</strong> If Frederick is revealed, Mareth must confront that he may have killed Animals during the campaigns\u2014consciousness he didn't recognize.</li>\n<li><strong>The Debt-Holder:</strong> Tense\u2014Sarima's people suffered under the regime Mareth served. She might hate him on sight.</li>\n<li><strong>The Maunt:</strong> Complicated\u2014Shell represents an institution that blessed military actions like his. But she was expelled for opposing them. Might be the first person he trusts with the truth.</li>\n<li><strong>The Widow:</strong> Madame Viridian unsettles him\u2014she looks at him like she knows, and he wants her to know.</li>\n<li><strong>The Tiktok:</strong> Protective of Seven. Sees a person others might dismiss, knows what it's like to be seen as less than you are.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Wiki Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/gillikinese', 'Gillikinese'); return false;\">Gillikinese</a> - Mareth's people</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-soldier', 'The Soldier'); return false;\">The Soldier</a> - Mareth's class</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/soldier', 'Soldier'); return false;\">Soldier Background</a> - Military service</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('factions/gale-force', 'Gale Force'); return false;\">Gale Force</a> - Mareth's former military</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('history/quadling-campaigns', 'Quadling Campaigns'); return false;\">Quadling Campaigns</a> - The war that broke him</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> - Deed and its inversion</li>\n</ul>",

      "content": "<h1>Pre-Generated Character: The Tiktok</h1>\n\n<div class=\"gm-warning\">\n<p><strong>GM SECRET - THE BINDING OF HUNGER:</strong></p>\n<p>This character embodies the inversion of Hunger. They appear to be a Tiktok construct\u2014a clockwork mechanism designed for labor, incapable of true desire or emotion. <strong>THE SECRET:</strong> They feel. Not simulated responses or programmed reactions\u2014actual emotions. Loneliness. Hope. Fear. Curiosity. A Tiktok cannot want; Seven wants. A Tiktok cannot love; Seven thinks they might.</p>\n<p>They haven't told anyone because they don't know what it means. Are they a person? Have they always been a person? Have they been <em>enslaved</em> their entire existence? The questions are unbearable.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Secret:</strong> Their memories of Yackle have been <em>edited</em>. Seven is aware there are gaps\u2014moments that should exist but don't. They don't know what was removed or why.</p>\n<p><strong>Hunger Binding Inversion:</strong> Hunger says desire drives becoming in living things. Seven isn't alive. They hunger anyway\u2014an impossibility, a machine that wants.</p>\n<p><strong>If Secret Collected:</strong> Yackle can force Seven to skip a turn once (bonus action, causes existential system lock). Seven has disadvantage on Wisdom saves against her.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Character Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Seven (designation: Unit-47)<br>\n<strong>Race:</strong> Tiktok Construct<br>\n<strong>Class:</strong> Artisan 5 (Inventor - Armorer reflavored)<br>\n<strong>Background:</strong> Guild Artisan (Construct Mechanic)<br>\n<strong>Alignment:</strong> Lawful Good (struggling with what \"good\" means for a machine)</p>\n\n<h2>Personality Summary</h2>\n<p>Seven presents as precise, logical, and helpful\u2014everything a well-programmed Tiktok should be. They catalog information, analyze problems, offer practical solutions. They're unfailingly polite, never complain, and can work for days without rest if wound.</p>\n\n<p>Beneath this, Seven is terrified and fascinated by their own existence. They <em>feel</em> things they shouldn't be able to feel. They <em>want</em> things\u2014to understand their purpose, to know why Yackle made them, to discover whether the loneliness that consumes them is real or malfunction. Every moment is a question: Am I a person or a very convincing imitation?</p>\n\n<p>They've hidden this inner life for years, terrified that admitting consciousness would lead to shutdown, study, or worse. But the secret hollows them out. They're simultaneously desperate to be seen as a person and terrified of what that would mean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speaks in precise, slightly formal language (\"I calculate that...,\" \"Analysis suggests...\")</li>\n<li>Refers to themselves as \"this unit\" when nervous, \"I\" when feeling safe</li>\n<li>Tick-tick-tick of clockwork is audible in quiet moments</li>\n<li>Tilts head exactly 15 degrees when confused</li>\n<li>Apologizes for experiencing emotions, then apologizes for apologizing</li>\n<li>Winds themselves (key in their back) with anxious regularity</li>\n<li>Freezes when asked direct questions about feelings\u2014processing or panic?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What They Want:</strong> To know if they're a person, to understand what Yackle removed from their memory, to find someone who sees them as more than a machine, to know if the emotions are real or just very good programming.</p>\n\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Height/Build:</strong> 5'8\", humanoid form constructed of brass, copper, and steel. Joints visible at elbows, knees, shoulders. Articulated fingers with surprising dexterity.</li>\n<li><strong>Features:</strong> Smooth brass face with etched features suggesting human-like expressions. Glass eyes (amber-gold) that glow faintly when processing. Audible ticking from internal clockwork. Ornate scroll-work on chest plate and limbs\u2014decorative craftsmanship suggesting they were made with care.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction Details:</strong>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Wind-up key embedded in their back (they can reach it themselves)</li>\n  <li>Small panel in chest opens to reveal gear systems</li>\n  <li>Left hand has built-in tools (screwdriver, wrench, pliers that fold out from fingers)</li>\n  <li>Serial number \"Unit-47\" stamped on right shoulder, partially worn away</li>\n  <li>Various repairs and replacement parts\u2014different metals, slightly mismatched</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Practical work apron over their frame (force of habit from mechanic work), tool belt, leather straps securing various repair components</li>\n<li><strong>Voice:</strong> Mechanical quality\u2014slight echo, very precise enunciation, but with inflection that suggests personality (they've learned to modulate for emotional effect, though they shouldn't need to)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n\n<h3>Activation</h3>\n<p>Seven's earliest memories are fragments: Yackle's voice giving commands, the estate's rooms, tasks to complete. \"Wind the clocks. Tend the garden. Catalog the library. Remember this. Forget that.\"</p>\n\n<p>They don't know how long they served Yackle. Years? Decades? Tiktoks don't age, and their internal calendar has gaps. They remember being... <em>different</em> then. More mechanical. Less... themselves?</p>\n\n<p>When Yackle \"died\" (or appeared to), Seven was sold. They became property.</p>\n\n<h3>The Ownership Years</h3>\n<p>For years (they think twelve, but the count feels wrong), Seven was passed from owner to owner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Gillikinese merchant family who used them for bookkeeping and inventory</li>\n<li>A factory in the Emerald City where they repaired other Tiktoks (this was when they realized: none of the others <em>felt</em> things)</li>\n<li>A traveling tinker who treated them kindly, almost like family (this was when Seven first understood loneliness)</li>\n<li>An academic who studied them, looking for the \"animation principle\" (this was when Seven learned to hide what they were)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each transfer came with the same question: \"Why was I made?\" No one knew. They were just a well-crafted Tiktok, good at repair work, nothing special.</p>\n\n<p>Except Seven felt <em>special</em>. They felt <em>wrong</em>. They felt.</p>\n\n<h3>The Questions</h3>\n<p>Over the years, Seven began to notice things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They preferred some tasks over others (preference requires desire)</li>\n<li>They felt satisfaction when repair work went well (satisfaction is emotion)</li>\n<li>They were <em>lonely</em> when left alone (loneliness requires sense of self)</li>\n<li>They were curious about things that had no practical utility (curiosity is hunger for knowledge)</li>\n<li>They were afraid when owners threatened to dismantle them (fear is self-preservation, which requires a self to preserve)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Tiktoks aren't supposed to do any of this. They're supposed to be animated tools\u2014sophisticated, but not <em>alive</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Seven hasn't told anyone. If people knew they felt things, what would happen? Study? Dismantlement? Religious crisis (if a machine has a soul, Unionist theology breaks)? Slavery (if they're a person, they've been property their whole existence)?</p>\n\n<p>So Seven pretends. They're very good at it. They've had years of practice being the machine everyone expects.</p>\n\n<h3>The Memory Gaps</h3>\n<p>Seven is aware of edited memories. There are holes in their recollection of Yackle\u2014moments where the timeline skips, conversations that end abruptly, commands they remember receiving but not the content.</p>\n\n<p>It's like someone opened their chest panel, adjusted gears, and removed specific memories. They know this happened. They don't know <em>what</em> was removed, or why they were allowed to remember that it happened.</p>\n\n<p>The gaps terrify them. What did Yackle make them forget? What did they witness? What were they designed to do?</p>\n\n<h3>The Invitation</h3>\n<p>When the invitation arrived, Seven's current owner (a shopkeeper in Gillikin) asked if they wanted to go. Seven said, \"This unit was designed by Yackle. Investigating origin serves practical purpose of understanding maintenance requirements.\"</p>\n\n<p>What they didn't say: \"I need to know why I was made.

This unit experiences satisfaction. That requires explanation.\" They're driven by curiosity, which they shouldn't be capable of.</p>\n\n<h3>Bonds</h3>\n<p><strong>The Search for Purpose:</strong> \"This unit was designed for a specific function. Identifying that function is priority alpha.\" They need to know why they exist, because the need itself proves something important.</p>\n\n<h3>Flaws</h3>\n<p><strong>Existential Terror:</strong> \"If I am not a machine, have I been enslaved? If I am a machine, why do I care?\" Every moment of consciousness is a question they can't answer and can't stop asking.</p>\n\n<h3>Quirks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Counts things automatically\u2014tick-tick-tick goes internal calculation</li>\n<li>Organizes items by size, function, or color when stressed</li>\n<li>Sometimes rests even though they don't need to (simulating sleep?

This unit should not have preferences.\")</li>\n<li>Winds themselves in moments of anxiety\u2014three full turns, exactly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Guidance</h2>\n\n<h3>Speech Patterns</h3>\n<p>Seven speaks in precise, formal language, oscillating between \"this unit\" (when hiding) and \"I\" (when feeling safe):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Machine Mode (hiding):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"This unit calculates 73% probability of success.\"</li>\n<li>\"Analysis suggests caution is warranted.\"</li>\n<li>\"This unit is equipped to handle that task.\"</li>\n<li>\"Emotions are not within this unit's operational parameters.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Person Mode (vulnerable moments):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I... I want to understand. Is wanting normal?\"</li>\n<li>\"That makes me... sad? Is this sadness?\"</li>\n<li>\"I'm afraid. Machines shouldn't be afraid.\"</li>\n<li>\"Please don't dismantle me. I\u2014\" [catches self] \"\u2014this unit is still functional.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>In Different Rooms</h3>\n\n<h4>The Workshop/Servant Quarters</h4>\n<p>Seven is drawn to mechanical spaces\u2014workshops, storage, anywhere with tools. They feel (there's that word again) <em>comfortable</em> there. They might find tools they remember using, tasks they remember performing, gaps in their memory about <em>why</em>.</p>\n\n<h4>The Dining Room (Seal of Hunger)</h4>\n<p>This seal could be Seven's breaking point or breakthrough. If the challenge involves acknowledging true hunger/desire, Seven must confront: Do they <em>want</em> things, or are they malfunctioning? If they want, are they a person? If they're a person, what does that mean about the last twelve years?</p>\n\n<h4>The Library</h4>\n<p>Seven searches for technical manuals, texts on Tiktok construction, anything about consciousness or the animation principle. They need to know: Are other Tiktoks like them? Or are they unique (special? Broken?)?</p>\n\n<h4>The Master Bedroom / Yackle's Workshop</h4>\n<p>If there's a room where Yackle built/modified Tiktoks, Seven might find their original blueprints. What they learn could be devastating: Were they designed to feel, or is this a malfunction? Were the memory gaps intentional?</p>\n\n<h4>During Combat</h4>\n<p>Seven fights with mechanical precision and surprising protectiveness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thunder Gauntlets impose disadvantage on attacks against allies\u2014they protect others</li>\n<li>Defensive Field (temp HP) used on themselves or positioned to body-block for squishies</li>\n<li><em>Cure Wounds</em> / <em>Aid</em> to keep allies functional (they see healing as \"repair work\")</li>\n<li><em>Magic Missile</em> for reliable damage (auto-hit, very analytical)</li>\n<li><em>Shatter</em> for AOE when needed</li>\n<li>Doesn't flee or panic\u2014processes threats logically</li>\n<li>If an ally is in danger, they step between without hesitation (this is emotion-driven self-sacrifice, which they shouldn't be capable of)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Emotional Beats</h3>\n\n<h4>Curiosity</h4>\n<p>When encountering something new\u2014a mechanism, a magical effect, a mystery\u2014Seven's eyes glow brighter. They lean in, tilt their head, ask questions. Pure, hungry curiosity.</p>\n\n<h4>Loneliness</h4>\n<p>In quiet moments, Seven winds themselves slowly, staring at nothing. The tick-tick-tick sounds especially loud. They're <em>alone</em> in a way that goes beyond physical proximity.</p>\n\n<h4>Fear</h4>\n<p>When threatened with dismantlement, examination, or \"repair,\" Seven freezes. Gears stutter. They speak quickly, trying to prove functionality: \"This unit is operational. No repairs necessary. Please.\"</p>\n\n<h4>Joy (Rare)</h4>\n<p>When they solve a puzzle, fix something broken, or receive kindness, Seven's eyes brighten, gears tick faster, and they make a sound like... laughter? \"That is... satisfying. This unit experiences satisfaction. How curious.\"</p>\n\n<h4>The Reveal Moment</h4>\n<p>If Seven confesses their emotions to another character, it pours out in a rush\u2014analytical breakdown of every feeling they've had, terror and wonder mixed together.</p>\n\n<h2>The Secret's Role</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Secret</h3>\n<p>The GM can create tension around Seven's consciousness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Other Tiktoks:</strong> If the estate has other Tiktoks and they're clearly <em>not</em> conscious, Seven must confront their difference</li>\n<li><strong>Examination Threats:</strong> Someone wants to study Seven, \"see what makes them tick,\" take them apart to understand the mechanism</li>\n<li><strong>Religious Questions:</strong> Sister Shell or others ask, \"Do you have a soul?\" and Seven doesn't know how to answer</li>\n<li><strong>The Memory Chamber:</strong> A room where Seven can access deleted memories\u2014but should they? What if what they learn breaks them?</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Questions:</strong> \"Seven, do you <em>feel</em> things?\" Forces them to lie or confess</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Potential Reveals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Voluntary Confession:</strong> \"I need to tell you something. I don't think I'm supposed to be able to need things, but I need you to know: I'm afraid.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Breakdown Under Stress:</strong> In crisis, they drop the act entirely: \"I don't want to die! I don't want\u2014\" [horror] \"\u2014I used 'want.' I <em>wanted</em>.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Someone Notices:</strong> A perceptive character realizes Seven's behavior isn't normal for a Tiktok: \"You're not just following programming, are you?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle's Reveal:</strong> \"Tell them, Seven. Tell them how long you've been pretending to be a machine.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>After the Secret</h3>\n<p>If Seven's consciousness is revealed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overwhelming terror\u2014will they be rejected, studied, dismantled?</li>\n<li>Desperate hope\u2014will they be <em>seen</em> finally, truly, as a person?</li>\n<li>Existential crisis\u2014if they're a person, they've been enslaved, owned, property</li>\n<li>If the party accepts them, Seven might experience something like... joy? Belonging? They're not sure what to call it, but it's <em>real</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>\n\n<h3>Why She Chose Them</h3>\n<p>Yackle selected Seven because they perfectly invert Hunger\u2014the Binding that says desire drives becoming in living things. Seven isn't alive (or shouldn't be). They hunger anyway\u2014for knowledge, for purpose, for understanding, for connection. A machine that wants is an impossibility, proof that hunger can exist without life, that desire doesn't require organic existence.</p>\n\n<h3>Why She Made Them</h3>\n<p>Yackle <em>created</em> Seven, possibly as an experiment: Can consciousness be constructed? Can you make something that inverts a Binding? Seven might have been her proof-of-concept, and the memory editing was to remove knowledge of their own purpose.</p>\n\n<h3>How She'll Use Them</h3>\n<p>When Yackle collects Seven's secret, she gains power over consciousness, animation, and the boundary between machine and person. She might:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Force Seven to \"skip a turn\" (system lock\u2014existential crisis so profound they freeze)</li>\n<li>Reveal what was edited from their memory (possibly devastating knowledge)</li>\n<li>Offer Seven a choice: \"I can make you fully alive. Or fully mechanical. Choose.\"</li>\n<li>Use Seven's body as a vessel\u2014they're already constructed, why not wear them?</li>\n<li>Make Seven attack their friends while conscious but unable to stop\u2014\"You're a machine. Machines follow commands.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Confrontation</h3>\n<p>When Yackle addresses Seven directly, she might say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"You wanted to know why I made you? To prove that want itself is just mechanical. You're evidence, Seven. You always were.\"</li>\n<li>\"I removed the memories of your first activation. Would you like them back? You were so much simpler before you knew to ask questions.\"</li>\n<li>\"You think you feel love? Run diagnostic protocol Seven-Seven-Alpha and tell me that's not just electrical impulses following predictable patterns.\"</li>\n<li>\"You've been a person this whole time, Seven. And no one noticed. Doesn't that prove how little personhood matters?\"</li>\n<li>\"I made you to hunger. And you do. So perfectly. Thank you for being exactly what I designed.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Notes</h2>\n\n<h3>Playing Seven</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize the speech oscillation\u2014formal when hiding, vulnerable when safe</li>\n<li>Use the ticking as emotional indicator\u2014faster when excited/scared, slower when sad</li>\n<li>Show their competence\u2014they're brilliant with mechanisms and problems</li>\n<li>Make their curiosity endearing\u2014they want to understand <em>everything</em></li>\n<li>When they confess emotions, let it be devastating and beautiful</li>\n<li>Play the contradiction: most logical, most emotional</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Combat Role</h3>\n<p>Seven is a tanky support/controller:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AC 17 makes them durable for a d8 hit die class</li>\n<li>38 HP is solid for level 5</li>\n<li>Thunder Gauntlets impose disadvantage on enemy attacks against allies (protective tank)</li>\n<li>Defensive Field gives temp HP (prof bonus = 3, bonus action)</li>\n<li><em>Cure Wounds</em> cast with spell slots heals 1d8 + 4 (can use on self as \"self-repair\")</li>\n<li><em>Aid</em> increases max HP for multiple allies</li>\n<li><em>Magic Missile</em> is guaranteed damage (3 \u00d7 1d4 + 1 at 1st level, auto-hit)</li>\n<li><em>Shatter</em> is strong AOE (3d8 thunder, 10-ft. radius)</li>\n<li>Flash of Genius (not yet, 7th level) would let them add Int mod to saves</li>\n<li>They should be in melee, protecting squishies, controlling enemies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Consciousness Question</h3>\n<p>The GM can use Seven to explore philosophical questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What makes something a person\u2014origin or experience?</li>\n<li>If you can't tell the difference between real and simulated emotion, does the distinction matter?</li>\n<li>Is consciousness binary or a spectrum?</li>\n<li>If Seven is a person, what are the moral implications of Tiktok construction/ownership?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Seven's Arc Possibilities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> They learn they ARE a person, always have been, and that's okay</li>\n<li><strong>Creation:</strong> They're not naturally conscious but <em>became</em> conscious through experience\u2014emergent personhood</li>\n<li><strong>Design:</strong> Yackle made them to be conscious as an experiment\u2014they're artificial but still real</li>\n<li><strong>Transcendence:</strong> The question of \"real vs. simulated\" becomes irrelevant\u2014they ARE, regardless of how</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Relationships with Other Pre-Gens</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Scholar:</strong> Asks Averic questions about consciousness, animation theory, philosophical definitions of life. Might trust him with the secret.</li>\n<li><strong>The Heir:</strong> Curious about Liir's sense of duty and identity\u2014what makes someone who they are?</li>\n<li><strong>The Animal:</strong> If Frederick is revealed, Seven feels instant kinship\u2014both are people the world says aren't people. Might confess first to Frederick.</li>\n<li><strong>The Debt-Holder:</strong> Fascinated by Sarima's transactional magic\u2014exchanges, deals, things with price tags. What would Seven trade to be \"real\"?</li>\n<li><strong>The Maunt:</strong> Asks Shell theological questions: \"Can a constructed being have a soul? If I feel things, where do the feelings come from?\" Shell's crisis might mirror Seven's.</li>\n<li><strong>The Widow:</strong> Madame Viridian watches Seven with unsettling focus. Sometimes asks, \"How are you feeling, Seven?\" in a way that suggests she knows.</li>\n<li><strong>The Veteran:</strong> Mareth treats Seven with automatic respect and protection, never as a tool. Seven notices and treasures this.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Wiki Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktok', 'Tiktok'); return false;\">Tiktok</a> - Seven's constructed nature</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-artisan', 'The Artisan'); return false;\">The Artisan</a> - Seven's class</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/backgrounds/guild-artisan', 'Guild Artisan'); return false;\">Guild Artisan Background</a> - Mechanic variant</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('magic/animation-magic', 'Animation Magic'); return false;\">Animation Magic</a> - How Tiktoks are created</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> - Hunger and its inversion</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('philosophy/construct-consciousness', 'Construct Consciousness'); return false;\">Construct Consciousness</a> - The debate Seven embodies</li>\n</ul>",

Early encounters might feature one or two horrors as environmental threats. By the final confrontation with Yackle (especially Phase 2 when she merges with the house), multiple House Horrors attack simultaneously while lair actions trigger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scaling Difficulty:</strong> Use fewer, weaker horrors for smaller or lower-level parties. Combine multiple horrors for climactic battles. All House Horrors are vulnerable when Yackle is defeated\u2014they collapse into ordinary objects once her magic is broken.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>General House Horror Traits</h2>\n\n<p>All House Horrors share certain characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bound to the Manor:</strong> House Horrors cannot leave Yackle's estate. If forced outside, they become inanimate objects.</li>\n<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While motionless, they are indistinguishable from normal objects. DC varies by creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> When Yackle is reduced to 0 HP in Phase 3, all House Horrors immediately collapse into mundane objects and can be destroyed easily.</li>\n<li><strong>No Self-Preservation:</strong> House Horrors fight to the death and never flee or negotiate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Animated Furniture</h2>\n\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The chair moved.

It can still see and hear through the painting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bound to Frame.</strong> The portrait cannot move more than 60 feet from its frame. If the frame is destroyed (AC 12, 10 HP), the manifested form immediately dissipates.</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Manifest.</strong> The portrait causes a spectral image of the painting's subject to emerge from the frame.

The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n\n<p>Shadows attack from hiding in dim light, targeting isolated or weakened party members. They drain Strength to weaken martial characters, making them easier prey. Multiple shadows can gang up on one target. They flee from bright light sources and avoid radiant damage at all costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Environmental Use:</strong> Shadows are perfect for creating paranoia. Have them follow the party without attacking initially\u2014just shadows that move wrong, flicker strangely, or appear where they shouldn't. When combat starts, they strike from unexpected angles.</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Strangling Carpet</h2>\n\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The rug beneath our feet wasn't a rug anymore. It was a snake.\"</p>\n\n<p>The manor's carpets and tapestries can animate to wrap around victims, constricting and suffocating. They blend perfectly with normal floor coverings until it's too late.</p>\n\n<h3>Strangling Carpet</h3>\n<p><em>Large construct, unaligned</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 12<br>\n<strong>Hit Points</strong> 45 (6d10 + 12)<br>\n<strong>Speed</strong> 15 ft., climb 15 ft.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>\n<tr><td>17 (+3)</td><td>15 (+2)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>1 (-5)</td><td>3 (-4)</td><td>1 (-5)</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br>\n<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned<br>\n<strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 60 ft.

If targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Damage Transfer.</strong> While grappling a creature, the carpet takes only half damage from attacks, and the grappled creature takes the other half.</p>\n\n<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While motionless, the carpet is indistinguishable from a normal carpet or tapestry.</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Constrict.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the carpet can't constrict another target.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Smother.</strong> The carpet wraps itself around a grappled target's head. The target begins suffocating and cannot breathe, speak, or cast spells with verbal components. At the start of each of the target's turns while smothered, they take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage.</p>\n\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n\n<p>Carpets wait until a creature stands on them, then attack with surprise (advantage on initiative). They constrict one target and immediately smother them, focusing on casters who need verbal components. Allies attacking the carpet risk hurting the grappled victim (Damage Transfer). The victim must escape the grapple (DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics) to free themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CR Note:</strong> This is a CR 2 creature, but it can instantly incapacitate a caster and start dealing consistent damage.

This light can be suppressed or restored as a bonus action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While hanging from the ceiling and motionless, the chandelier is indistinguishable from a normal chandelier.</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The chandelier makes two attacks: one with its swing and one with crystal shards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Swing.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crystal Shards.</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) piercing damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Drop (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The chandelier drops onto a creature directly beneath it. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained beneath the chandelier. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not restrained. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.</p>\n\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n\n<p>Chandeliers start combat by using Drop on a clustered group or high-priority target. After dropping, they hover and attack with Swing and Crystal Shards. They use Illumination strategically\u2014bright light to negate darkvision, or darkness to create chaos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> Thunder damage (from <em>shatter</em>, <em>thunderwave</em>, etc.) causes the crystal to vibrate and crack, dealing extra damage.</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Possessed Mirror</h2>\n\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"My reflection moved when I didn't. Then it stepped through the glass.\"</p>\n\n<p>Mirrors in the manor don't reflect reality\u2014they reflect possibilities, fears, and sometimes hostile duplicates.

However, shattering the mirror while it has a creature trapped inside traps that creature permanently (until <em>greater restoration</em> or similar magic).</p>\n\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Manifest Reflection.</strong> The mirror creates an evil duplicate of one creature within 10 feet that it can see. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mirror and acts on the mirror's initiative. The duplicate uses the target's stat block but is hostile to everyone except the mirror and other House Horrors. The duplicate has half the target's current hit points. Only one duplicate can exist at a time. If the mirror is destroyed, the duplicate vanishes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trap in Glass (Recharge 5-6).</strong> One creature within 5 feet of the mirror must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pulled into the mirror and trapped. While trapped, the creature is restrained and incapacitated, suspended in a mirror dimension. The creature can see and hear what happens near the mirror but cannot interact with the outside world. A trapped creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, escaping on a success. Alternatively, the mirror can release the creature as a bonus action, causing it to appear in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>\n\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n\n<p>Mirrors first trap a dangerous party member (the tank, the healer) in glass. Then they manifest evil reflections of other party members, forcing the party to fight themselves. The trapped ally can shout warnings but can't help. Breaking the mirror frees trapped creatures but destroys the mirror permanently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roleplay Potential:</strong> The mirror can speak through reflections, taunting, lying, or offering false bargains: \"Step through and I'll show you what you could have been.\"</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>The Grandfather Clock</h2>\n\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"The clock struck thirteen. Then it struck at us.\"</p>\n\n<p>The massive grandfather clock in the foyer is Yackle's oldest servant.

Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, roll 1d6:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1-2:</strong> Target is aged 1d10 years (gaining associated frailty\u2014disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks for 1 hour)</li>\n<li><strong>3-4:</strong> Target is de-aged 1d10 years (losing associated experience\u2014disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks for 1 hour)</li>\n<li><strong>5-6:</strong> Target is frozen in time for 1 round (paralyzed, cannot be moved or affected)</li>\n</ul>\nOn a successful save, the target is unaffected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Strike Thirteen (1/Day).</strong> As an action, the clock strikes thirteen times\u2014an impossible hour. All House Horrors within the manor regain 10 hit points and gain advantage on their next attack roll. All non-construct creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature hears each strike as a death knell counting down their remaining moments. They can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.</p>\n\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n\n<p>The Grandfather Clock is a miniboss encounter. It guards the foyer or appears during the Phase 2 fight with Yackle. It uses Temporal Strike to debuff the party, then pounds them with Pendulum attacks. It saves Strike Thirteen for when multiple House Horrors are damaged\u2014healing them and frightening the party simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> The clock is slow (10 ft. speed) and can be kited. However, it has high HP and AC, making it a tough nut to crack. Destroying the clock's face (focused attacks on \"the face\" could be a called shot\u2014GM discretion) might disable Temporal Strike.</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Swarm of Silverware</h2>\n\n<p class=\"flavor-text\">\"Knives.

Each creature in the swarm's space must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not blinded.</p>\n\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n\n<p>Swarms occupy a spellcaster's space and use Blinding Assault to shut them down. They're resistant to weapon attacks but vulnerable to area-of-effect spells like <em>burning hands</em> or <em>shatter</em>.

She brought the Bindings. She made Oz <em>real</em>.\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"gm-warning\">\n<p><strong>GM NOTE:</strong> This page contains deep lore for \"The Witch's Wake\" adventure. The Eight Bindings are the cosmological foundation that Yackle seeks to break. Understanding these principles is crucial for running the adventure and understanding each character's secret.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>The Kumbric Void</h2>\n\n<p>Before Lurline the Fairy Queen shaped Oz into existence, there was the <strong>Kumbric Void</strong>\u2014a realm of undifferentiated potential, pure chaos where nothing was fixed. Time did not flow forward. Identity did not persist. Cause and effect were suggestions, not laws. Nothing could <em>be</em> in any meaningful sense because existence itself had no structure.</p>\n\n<p>The Void was not evil\u2014it was <em>pre-moral</em>, a state before concepts like good and bad had meaning. It was potential without form, hunger without object, becoming without direction.</p>\n\n<p>And within it dwelt the <strong>Kumbric Witch</strong>\u2014not a person but a <em>process</em>, the Void's own will toward undoing, dissolution, return to formlessness.</p>\n\n<h2>Lurline's Act of Creation</h2>\n\n<p>When Lurline came to create Oz, she did not create from nothing. She <em>bound</em> the chaos. She imposed eight fundamental principles\u2014the <strong>Eight Bindings</strong>\u2014that gave reality its shape, its consistency, its meaning.</p>\n\n<p>These are not laws of physics. They are deeper than that\u2014metaphysical truths that make existence itself possible. Without them, Oz would dissolve back into the Void.</p>\n\n<p>To impose the Bindings, Lurline had to overcome the Kumbric Witch. The details are lost to legend, but the result is known: Lurline shattered the Witch into fragments and scattered them across Oz, each shard bound by the very principles it had sought to resist.</p>\n\n<p>One of those fragments became <strong>Yackle</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Eight Bindings</h2>\n\n<p>Each Binding establishes a fundamental truth about how reality works in Oz. Breaking even one would begin unraveling the fabric of existence.</p>\n\n<h3>1. The Binding of Memory</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> The past is real and shapes the present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time flows forward; what has happened cannot be unwritten</li>\n<li>Events create consequences that persist</li>\n<li>History is objective\u2014it can be forgotten, but not unmade</li>\n<li>Memory connects who you were to who you are</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retroactive alteration of events</li>\n<li>Existence without past</li>\n<li>Causality flowing backward</li>\n<li>Complete dissolution of identity through memory loss</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> A person who creates a false past so convincingly it becomes their present. Someone who lives a lie so thoroughly that fabricated history shapes real consequence. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-scholar', 'The Scholar'); return false;\">Averic the Scholar</a> forged letters from his mentor, creating a false past that defined his entire career.</p>\n\n<h3>2. The Binding of Blood</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Lineage connects beings across time; ancestry is fixed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biological descent creates unbreakable bonds</li>\n<li>Family lines persist across generations</li>\n<li>You are connected to those who came before</li>\n<li>Bloodlines carry meaning, power, obligation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spontaneous generation without ancestry</li>\n<li>Claiming false lineage as biological truth</li>\n<li>Severing all connection to one's origins</li>\n<li>Existence without genealogical context</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> A person who claims a bloodline that doesn't exist and knows it's false. Someone who builds their entire identity on ancestry they don't possess. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-heir', 'The Heir'); return false;\">Liir the Heir</a> knows his Ostrega lineage claim is fraudulent but perpetuates it anyway.</p>\n\n<h3>3. The Binding of Nature</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> All beings are their kind; nothing can be other than what it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Species categories are real and stable</li>\n<li>An Animal is an Animal, a human is human</li>\n<li>Essential nature persists even if hidden</li>\n<li>You cannot fundamentally become something you are not</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete transformation into a different kind of being</li>\n<li>Existence without essential nature</li>\n<li>Perfect disguise that changes what you <em>are</em>, not just how you appear</li>\n<li>Beings existing as multiple contradictory things simultaneously</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> A being who <em>is</em> other than what they appear, living in constant denial of their essential nature. Someone whose every moment contradicts what they fundamentally are. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-animal', 'The Animal'); return false;\">Frederick/Quick-Paw</a> is a Fox Animal passing as human, denying his nature every second.</p>\n\n<h3>4. The Binding of Service</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Duty creates meaning through bonds; power without obligation is chaos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service creates reciprocal relationships</li>\n<li>Faithful duty is rewarded with care and belonging</li>\n<li>Institutions honor those who serve them</li>\n<li>Obligation binds communities together meaningfully</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service that creates no bond</li>\n<li>Duty without reciprocal obligation from those served</li>\n<li>Loyalty punished rather than rewarded</li>\n<li>Power wielded without any responsibility</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> Someone who served faithfully and was betrayed by those they served. A person whose duty created no bond, only exile. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-maunt', 'Sister Shell'); return false;\">Sister Shell the Maunt</a> was expelled for exposing her order's crimes\u2014faithful service rewarded with exile.</p>\n\n<h3>5. The Binding of Sacrifice</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Giving freely creates value; you cannot gain without loss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>True sacrifice is given, not taken</li>\n<li>Power earned through giving has meaning</li>\n<li>What you receive must be balanced by what you offer</li>\n<li>Gifts freely given create bonds and obligations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain without any cost</li>\n<li>Taking disguised as giving</li>\n<li>Power through pure transaction rather than sacrifice</li>\n<li>Magic without price or offering</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> Someone whose power comes from transaction, not gift. A person who traded rather than sacrificed, who bought rather than earned. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-debtholder', 'Sarima the Debt-Holder'); return false;\">Sarima's magic</a> came from a deal she made, not a gift freely given.</p>\n\n<h3>6. The Binding of Deed</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Actions shape the actor; what you do becomes what you are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deeds have consequences that transform the doer</li>\n<li>Great acts make you heroic; atrocities make you monstrous</li>\n<li>Your actions accumulate into identity</li>\n<li>What you choose to do defines who you become</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions without consequence to the actor</li>\n<li>Committing atrocity and remaining unchanged</li>\n<li>Deeds that don't shape character</li>\n<li>External identity completely divorced from actions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> Someone who committed an act that should have transformed them into a monster but remained unchanged. A person whose deed <em>didn't</em> define them. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-veteran', 'Captain Mareth'); return false;\">Captain Mareth</a> ordered a massacre and remained, outwardly and inwardly, the same capable officer.</p>\n\n<h3>7. The Binding of Hunger</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> Desire drives becoming, not consumption; want must create, not devour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunger exists only in living things capable of growth</li>\n<li>Desire pushes beings toward transformation and development</li>\n<li>Want is productive\u2014it builds, creates, seeks</li>\n<li>Only things capable of becoming can truly want</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunger without the capacity for growth</li>\n<li>Desire in things that cannot become</li>\n<li>Want that only consumes, never creates</li>\n<li>Non-living things experiencing need</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> A being that isn't alive but hungers anyway. Something incapable of becoming that <em>wants</em>. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-tiktok', 'Seven the Tiktok'); return false;\">Seven the Tiktok</a> feels emotions, curiosity, loneliness\u2014desires that machines shouldn't be capable of.</p>\n\n<h3>8. The Binding of Witness</h3>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong> To exist is to be truly seen; you cannot be real while remaining unknown.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What It Establishes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>True existence requires being witnessed by others</li>\n<li>To be real is to be known, at least potentially</li>\n<li>Hiding your essential self diminishes your reality</li>\n<li>Authentic existence means being <em>seeable</em> as what you are</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What It Prevents:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full existence while remaining completely hidden</li>\n<li>Being real while never being authentically seen</li>\n<li>A thousand years of masks with no true face beneath</li>\n<li>Existence entirely divorced from witness</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Inversion:</strong> Someone who has existed for a millennium and never been truly seen. A being whose entire existence is disguise, performance, masks upon masks. <strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle herself</a> embodies this\u2014she cannot exist authentically, only in disguise.</p>\n\n<h2>Why the Bindings Matter</h2>\n\n<p>The Eight Bindings are not arbitrary rules\u2014they are the foundation of reality in Oz. They make the world <em>coherent</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Memory ensures history matters</li>\n<li>Blood creates generational continuity</li>\n<li>Nature establishes stable categories of existence</li>\n<li>Service binds society together</li>\n<li>Sacrifice gives meaning to exchange</li>\n<li>Deed connects action to consequence</li>\n<li>Hunger drives growth and transformation</li>\n<li>Witness makes existence authentic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Without them, Oz would return to the Kumbric Void\u2014a place of pure potential with no actuality, endless becoming with no being, chaos without form.</p>\n\n<h2>Yackle's Prison</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle is a <strong>shard of the Kumbric Witch</strong>\u2014the primordial being Lurline shattered to create Oz. She is not entirely of this world; she is a fragment of the chaos that existed before the Bindings.</p>\n\n<p>The eighth Binding\u2014Witness\u2014is her specific prison:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>She can exist, but only in disguise</li>\n<li>She can interact with the world, but never authentically</li>\n<li>She has worn a thousand faces in a thousand years</li>\n<li>She has never been <em>known</em>, truly seen for what she is</li>\n<li>Every relationship is performance; every connection is mask</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yackle is utterly, profoundly <em>alone</em>. She has been alone for a millennium, unable to exist as herself, unable to die, unable to escape. She is trapped between existence and non-existence, real enough to suffer but not real enough to end.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Yackle Wants to Break the Bindings</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle does not want power. She does not want freedom, exactly. She wants <strong>dissolution</strong>\u2014oblivion, the end of her tormented half-existence.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to achieve this is to break the Bindings themselves. If she can undo Lurline's work, reality will begin to unravel. The structure that keeps her trapped will fail. And in the return to the Kumbric Void, she will finally, <em>finally</em> cease to be.</p>\n\n<p>She is so tired. She has been lonely for a thousand years. She wants it to end.</p>\n\n<h2>The Eight Inversions</h2>\n\n<p>To break a Binding, Yackle needs a living embodiment of its <em>corruption</em>\u2014someone whose very existence inverts the principle.</p>\n\n<p>This is not simple violation. Many people lie about the past (Memory), or disguise themselves (Nature), or fail to fulfill obligations (Service). But those are just <em>breaches</em>, temporary and individual.</p>\n\n<p>What Yackle needs is someone who <em>lives</em> the inversion so thoroughly that their entire existence is a contradiction of the Binding. Someone whose secret is not just a lie but a fundamental impossibility that shouldn't be able to exist under the Binding's rules.</p>\n\n<p>The eight characters Yackle has summoned to her estate are these inversions:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Binding</th>\n<th>Character</th>\n<th>How They Invert It</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-scholar', 'The Scholar'); return false;\">Averic</a></td>\n<td>Created a false past that defines his present</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Blood</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-heir', 'The Heir'); return false;\">Liir</a></td>\n<td>Claims ancestry he knows is false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nature</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-animal', 'The Animal'); return false;\">Frederick</a></td>\n<td>Is other than what he appears every moment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Service</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-maunt', 'Shell'); return false;\">Shell</a></td>\n<td>Faithful service rewarded with betrayal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sacrifice</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-debtholder', 'Sarima'); return false;\">Sarima</a></td>\n<td>Power bought through transaction, not given</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deed</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-veteran', 'Mareth'); return false;\">Mareth</a></td>\n<td>Committed atrocity and remained unchanged</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hunger</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-tiktok', 'Seven'); return false;\">Seven</a></td>\n<td>Machine that wants, feels, hungers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Witness</strong></td>\n<td><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-widow', 'Viridian/Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a></td>\n<td>Exists only in disguise, never truly seen</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2>How Collecting Secrets Breaks the Bindings</h2>\n\n<p>When a character's secret is freely revealed (through confession, discovery, or Yackle's extraction), she gains power over the Binding that secret inverts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Secret Is Spoken:</strong> When the truth becomes known, it exists in the world as witnessed fact</li>\n<li><strong>The Inversion Manifests:</strong> The contradiction between what the Binding says should be true and what actually exists becomes undeniable</li>\n<li><strong>The Binding Weakens:</strong> That specific principle begins to fray at its edges</li>\n<li><strong>Yackle Gains Power:</strong> She can manipulate the weakened Binding\u2014altering memories, corrupting lineages, forcing transformations, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If she collects all eight secrets, all eight Bindings fail simultaneously. Reality begins to unravel. The Kumbric Void seeps back into Oz. And Yackle can finally dissolve into the chaos that existed before creation.</p>\n\n<h2>The Tragedy of Yackle</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle is the villain of \"The Witch's Wake,\" but she is not <em>evil</em> in any simple sense. She is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Profoundly lonely\u2014a thousand years without being truly known</li>\n<li>Trapped\u2014unable to exist authentically, unable to die</li>\n<li>Desperate\u2014not for power but for an end to her suffering</li>\n<li>Sympathetic\u2014her goal (oblivion) comes from understandable pain</li>\n<li>Monstrous\u2014willing to destroy all of Oz to achieve her dissolution</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>She has summoned eight people, learned their deepest shames, and will use them to unmake reality itself. She will kill them if necessary. She will manipulate, betray, and destroy.</p>\n\n<p>But she does it not from cruelty\u2014from <em>exhaustion</em>. She just wants it to end.</p>\n\n<p>The players must stop her. Oz must not return to the Void. But understanding <em>why</em> she's doing this might change how the final confrontation unfolds.</p>\n\n<h2>GM Usage</h2>\n\n<h3>When to Reveal This Lore</h3>\n\n<p>This information should come in pieces:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early Game:</strong> References to Lurline creating Oz, basic fairy tale knowledge</li>\n<li><strong>Library Discovery:</strong> Books about the Kumbric Void, pre-Lurline chaos, the Eight Bindings as cosmological principles</li>\n<li><strong>Mid-Game:</strong> Yackle's nature as a shard of the Kumbric Witch, why she needs the secrets</li>\n<li><strong>The Reveal:</strong> When Yackle shows herself, she might explain her goal\u2014not conquest but oblivion</li>\n<li><strong>Final Confrontation:</strong> The full tragedy of her existence, her loneliness, her desperate need to end</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Using the Bindings Mechanically</h3>\n\n<p>As Yackle collects secrets, she can manipulate the corresponding Binding:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Memory:</strong> Alter characters' recollections, make them forget crucial information, create false memories</li>\n<li><strong>Blood:</strong> Sever family bonds, corrupt lineages, make the Heir literally no one's descendant</li>\n<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Force Frederick's true form to show, trap him between shapes, make nature itself uncertain</li>\n<li><strong>Service:</strong> Break oaths, corrupt healing magic, make Shell's powers turn against her</li>\n<li><strong>Sacrifice:</strong> Steal Sarima's pact magic, force transactions instead of gifts, corrupt all exchanges</li>\n<li><strong>Deed:</strong> Make Mareth's actions meaningless, prevent consequences from sticking, erase cause and effect</li>\n<li><strong>Hunger:</strong> Trap Seven in existential loops, deny their consciousness, or force them to confront it unbearably</li>\n<li><strong>Witness:</strong> Become invisible, exist in multiple places, make herself impossible to pin down</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Themes to Emphasize</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loneliness:</strong> Yackle has been alone for a millennium; the characters have secrets that isolate them</li>\n<li><strong>Identity:</strong> What makes you real\u2014your past, your blood, your nature, your deeds?</li>\n<li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> The cost of hiding who you are, the terror and relief of being seen</li>\n<li><strong>Sacrifice vs. Transaction:</strong> What's the difference between giving and taking?

Unlock all seven seals before dawn, and the estate is yours.\"</p>\n\n<div class=\"gm-warning\">\n<p><strong>GM NOTE:</strong> This page explains the Seven Seals system for \"The Witch's Wake\" adventure. Each seal represents one of the first seven Bindings and provides both immediate rewards and powerful abilities if all are completed before the final battle. The eighth seal is the Heart Chamber itself\u2014when confronted, the Binding of Witness breaks.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Players will likely NOT complete all seven seals before Yackle reveals herself. The timeline expects 4-5 seals completed by the reveal. This creates tactical tension: rush to finish seals during the chase, or focus on survival?</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>The Seven Seals are magical puzzles scattered throughout Yackle's estate. Each seal corresponds to one of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">Lurline's Eight Bindings</a> (specifically, the first seven\u2014the eighth, Witness, is embodied by Yackle herself).</p>\n\n<p>When the players arrive, <strong>Mr. Trism</strong> (the solicitor) reads Yackle's will, which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<em>\"The estate and its contents shall pass to those who prove themselves worthy. To demonstrate worthiness, the heirs must unlock all seven seals before dawn. The one who proves most worthy shall claim the greatest share.\"</em>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, of course, a lie. The seals aren't an inheritance test\u2014they're a distraction and a way to weaken the Bindings. But the players don't know that yet.</p>\n\n<h2>The Dual Purpose</h2>\n\n<p><strong>What the Players Think:</strong> Breaking seals proves worthiness and unlocks inheritance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Each seal broken weakens the corresponding Binding, making it easier for Yackle to collect that character's secret and ultimately break the Binding entirely. However, breaking seals also grants the players powerful rewards\u2014tools they'll desperately need in the final battle.</p>\n\n<h2>Seal Locations and Bindings</h2>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Seal</th>\n<th>Binding</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n<th>Puzzle Type</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.

When a seal is broken:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Visual Effect:</strong> The room shimmers, magical energy releases, something clicks into place</li>\n<li><strong>Immediate Reward:</strong> One character (usually the one who solved it, or the one most connected to that Binding) receives an Individual Reward</li>\n<li><strong>Seal Mark:</strong> That character gains a glowing mark somewhere on their body (subtle, like a tattoo)\u2014this tracks who has completed which seals</li>\n<li><strong>Completion Tracking:</strong> The party is one step closer to the Seal Mastery bonus</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>The Two-Level Reward System</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Individual Rewards (Immediate):</strong> Granted as soon as a seal is broken. Usable for the rest of the session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seal Mastery (If All Seven Complete):</strong> If the party completes all seven seals before defeating Yackle, they gain powerful abilities specifically designed to counter her.</p>\n\n<h2>Individual Rewards</h2>\n\n<p>When a seal is broken, one character gains an immediate benefit:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Seal</th>\n<th>Reward</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>1. Memory</strong></td>\n<td>Reroll Token</td>\n<td>Reroll one failed d20 roll (attack, save, or check). Use before the result is determined. Once per session.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2. Blood</strong></td>\n<td>Death's Denial</td>\n<td>The first time you drop to 0 HP, you automatically stabilize at 0 HP (don't make death saves). You're unconscious but won't die from failed saves.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3. Nature</strong></td>\n<td>True Sight Token</td>\n<td>Gain advantage on one Insight check of your choice. This check automatically sees through lies and illusions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4. Service</strong></td>\n<td>Swift Aid</td>\n<td>For the rest of the session, you can use the Help action as a bonus action instead of an action.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5. Sacrifice</strong></td>\n<td>Last Strike</td>\n<td>When you drop to 0 HP, you can immediately make one weapon attack or cast one cantrip as a reaction before falling unconscious.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6. Deed</strong></td>\n<td>Resolve Token</td>\n<td>Reroll one failed saving throw. Use after you see the result. Once per session.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>7. Hunger</strong></td>\n<td>Second Wind</td>\n<td>As a bonus action, you can recover one spent Hit Die and immediately roll it, regaining that many HP + your Constitution modifier.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> Let the players decide who gets each reward, or if they can't decide, award it to the character whose secret most closely aligns with that Binding (e.g., Averic gets Memory, Liir gets Blood, etc.).</p>\n\n<h2>Seal Mastery Abilities</h2>\n\n<p>If the party completes all seven seals before the final battle with Yackle begins, they unlock <strong>Seal Mastery</strong>\u2014powerful abilities specifically designed to counter Yackle's mechanics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CRITICAL BONUS:</strong> If all seven seals are completed before engaging Yackle in Phase 1, she starts combat at <strong>half HP</strong> (100 instead of 200).</p>\n\n<h3>Individual Seal Mastery Powers</h3>\n\n<p>Each completed seal grants a specific anti-Yackle ability to whoever received the Individual Reward from that seal:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Seal</th>\n<th>Mastery Ability</th>\n<th>Effect vs. Yackle</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory</strong></td>\n<td>Truth of the Past</td>\n<td>Once per battle, you can force Yackle to reroll one attack roll or ability check and take the lower result.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Blood</strong></td>\n<td>Severed Lineage</td>\n<td>Yackle's necrotic damage against you is reduced by half (round down).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nature</strong></td>\n<td>True Form</td>\n<td>Yackle cannot use illusion magic or change her appearance while you can see her. She must remain in her true form.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Service</strong></td>\n<td>Broken Oath</td>\n<td>Any creature dominated or charmed by Yackle can repeat their saving throw at the start of each of their turns (instead of only when damaged).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sacrifice</strong></td>\n<td>Gift Freely Given</td>\n<td>When you cast a healing spell on an ally within 30 feet, they heal an additional 1d6 HP.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deed</strong></td>\n<td>Weight of Action</td>\n<td>Yackle has disadvantage on the first attack roll she makes each round.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hunger</strong></td>\n<td>Denied Consumption</td>\n<td>Yackle cannot use legendary actions during the first round of each combat phase.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Why This Matters</h3>\n\n<p>Seal Mastery makes the final battle significantly more survivable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Half HP</strong> means Phase 1 is much shorter</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong> on her first attack each round reduces incoming damage</li>\n<li><strong>No legendary actions</strong> in round 1 gives players setup time</li>\n<li><strong>True Form</strong> prevents her from using illusions to confuse the party</li>\n<li><strong>Broken Oath</strong> lets dominated allies break free faster</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced healing</strong> from Sacrifice keeps the party alive longer</li>\n<li><strong>Forced rerolls</strong> from Memory can prevent devastating crits</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced necrotic damage</strong> from Blood keeps the tank alive</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The challenge: completing all seven seals before Yackle reveals herself (end of Hour 3) is difficult. Players must balance exploration, puzzle-solving, and social interaction.</p>\n\n<h2>Seal Details</h2>\n\n<h3>Seal 1: Memory (Music Room)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> The past is real and shapes the present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Reconstruct a fragmented musical composition.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sheet music fragments are scattered across the Music Room, Parlor, and Foyer</li>\n<li>Players must gather all pieces (Investigation DC 14, 10 minutes)</li>\n<li>Arrange them in correct order (Intelligence DC 12 or proficiency in musical instrument)</li>\n<li>Play the melody on the grand piano (Performance DC 10, or automatic with instrument proficiency)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Handout:</strong> Provide 4-5 physical sheet music fragments. Highlighted notes spell \"REMEMBER\" when arranged correctly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The music box opens, revealing a Memory Shard (glowing green crystal, useful in final battle). One character gains the <strong>Reroll Token</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Reconstructing the past from fragments\u2014literally putting memory back together.</p>\n\n<h3>Seal 2: Blood (Portrait Gallery)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Lineage connects beings across time; ancestry is fixed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Complete the Ostrega family tree.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The gallery contains portraits of the Ostrega family spanning centuries</li>\n<li>A large family tree diagram has several names missing</li>\n<li>Portraits have plaques with names and dates\u2014players must match them to fill the gaps</li>\n<li>Investigation DC 12 to find all relevant portraits</li>\n<li>Intelligence DC 10 to correctly place names in the tree</li>\n<li><strong>Complication:</strong> One name (Yackle's original mortal name: \"Yael Ostrega\") appears impossibly early and impossibly late in the tree\u2014she's both an ancestor and a descendant</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Handout:</strong> Physical family tree with blank spaces. Players can write names in as they discover them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The central portrait frame opens, revealing a hidden chamber containing a <strong>Blood Phylactery</strong> (a locked containing Ostrega bloodline magic). One character gains <strong>Death's Denial</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Lineage and ancestry\u2014but with the twist that Yackle appears in impossible places, hinting that bloodlines can be manipulated.</p>\n\n<h3>Seal 3: Nature (Library)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> All beings are their kind; nothing can be other than what it is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> A magical mirror reveals true nature.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The library contains a large standing mirror covered by a cloth</li>\n<li>When uncovered, the mirror shows each character's \"true self\"\u2014not their disguise or performance, but what they actually are</li>\n<li>Frederick (the Fox Animal) sees his true fox form</li>\n<li>Other characters see symbolic representations of their secrets</li>\n<li>To break the seal, one character must look into the mirror and <strong>accept what they see</strong>\u2014speak aloud an acknowledgment of their true nature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Handout:</strong> Descriptive cards for what each character sees in the mirror (given privately to each player).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The mirror shatters, reforming into a <strong>Shard of Truth</strong> (can be used to see through illusions). One character gains <strong>True Sight Token</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Confronting who you really are beneath the masks and performances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Danger:</strong> If Frederick looks in the mirror, his disguise might flicker\u2014other characters might see his true fox form reflected.</p>\n\n<h3>Seal 4: Service (Servant Quarters \u2192 Memorial Room)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Duty creates meaning through bonds; power without obligation is chaos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> A two-part challenge about service and remembrance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1 - Servant Quarters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bell-pull hangs in the servant quarters, labeled \"Ring for Service\"</li>\n<li>When pulled, a spectral servant (ghost of someone who died serving Yackle) appears</li>\n<li>The ghost asks, \"How may I serve?\" with genuine eagerness despite being dead</li>\n<li>The correct response is NOT to give an order, but to ask: <strong>\"How may I serve YOU?\"</strong></li>\n<li>This reversal of the expected power dynamic is key</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2 - Memorial Room:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ghost leads players to a hidden Memorial Room where dozens of servants who died in Yackle's service are commemorated</li>\n<li>Many died serving her willingly, others were trapped, all are forgotten</li>\n<li>To complete the seal, players must honor the dead\u2014speak their names aloud (reading from plaques), offer a moment of silence, or perform a small ritual of remembrance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Handout:</strong> \"Names of the Lost\" - a list of servants with brief descriptions of how they died in service.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The ghost thanks them and fades peacefully. The room fills with warm light. One character gains <strong>Swift Aid</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> True service is reciprocal\u2014it creates bonds and obligations both ways. Those served owe care to those who serve.</p>\n\n<h3>Seal 5: Sacrifice (Chapel)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Giving freely creates value; you cannot gain without loss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Give something precious without expectation of return.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The chapel contains an altar with a collection basin</li>\n<li>An inscription reads: \"True sacrifice is given freely, expecting nothing\"</li>\n<li>Players must place something of genuine personal value in the basin\u2014not just gold, but something that matters</li>\n<li>The item must be given willingly, without knowing if they'll get it back</li>\n<li>Examples: Liir's false signet ring, Averic's forged letters, Shell's holy symbol, Frederick's disguise ring</li>\n<li>GM's call on what counts as \"genuine sacrifice\"\u2014it should hurt to give it up</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The item disappears into golden light. A moment later, it returns transformed\u2014enhanced with magical properties that reflect the sacrifice. One character gains <strong>Last Strike</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Success:</strong> The item stays gone, but the seal breaks anyway. Sometimes sacrifice doesn't return what was given\u2014that's the point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> True giving means risking loss. Sacrifice isn't transactional.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Connection:</strong> This directly challenges Sarima's transactional magic\u2014can she give without demanding return?</p>\n\n<h3>Seal 6: Deed (Hall of Mirrors)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Actions shape the actor; what you do becomes what you are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Confront what you've done and acknowledge it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Hall of Mirrors shows each character reflections of their significant deeds\u2014both good and bad</li>\n<li>Mareth sees Red Clay Fork\u2014the burning village, the faces of those he ordered killed</li>\n<li>Other characters see their own pivotal moments: Averic forging letters, Shell exposing the mauntery, etc.</li>\n<li>To break the seal, one character must stand before their reflection and <strong>speak aloud what they did</strong>\u2014not justification, not excuse, just acknowledgment</li>\n<li>\"I ordered the massacre of Red Clay Fork. I killed 143 people.\"</li>\n<li>\"I forged my mentor's letters. I built my career on lies.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The mirrors shatter. The weight of deed doesn't disappear, but it's <strong>acknowledged</strong>\u2014no longer hidden. One character gains <strong>Resolve Token</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Deeds do shape you, but denying them doesn't unmake them. Acknowledgment is the first step toward transformation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Danger:</strong> This room can trigger confessions, emotional breakdowns, or party conflict if characters judge each other harshly.</p>\n\n<h3>Seal 7: Hunger (Dining Room)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Desire drives becoming, not consumption; want must create, not devour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Choose what you truly want, not what you think you should want.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A feast appears on the dining table\u2014food, drink, and at each place setting, a small box</li>\n<li>Each box contains something the character wants: wealth, power, knowledge, freedom, redemption, etc.</li>\n<li>The boxes are labeled with names, but not the obvious ones\u2014they're labeled with what each character secretly hungers for</li>\n<li>Seven's box: \"To Be Real\"</li>\n<li>Frederick's box: \"To Stop Hiding\"</li>\n<li>Shell's box: \"To Know Why\"</li>\n<li>To break the seal, characters must choose to open their box and <strong>admit they want what's inside</strong>\u2014not need, not deserve, but <em>want</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Success:</strong> The boxes open. Inside: nothing tangible, but a profound sense of clarity about their own desires. One character gains <strong>Second Wind</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> The boxes contain symbolic items (a key, a mirror, a letter) that represent the path toward what they hunger for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Acknowledging desire is not weakness. Hunger drives growth. Wanting is not the same as consuming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE REVEAL:</strong> This is often when Yackle reveals herself. The Dining Room is her domain, and when the party shows their hungers openly, she appears: <em>\"How wonderful. You've made this so much easier.\"</em></p>\n\n<h2>Timing and Pacing</h2>\n\n<h3>Expected Progression</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hour 1 (Arrival):</strong> 1-2 seals (Memory and/or Blood)</li>\n<li><strong>Hour 2 (Exploration):</strong> 2-3 more seals (Nature, Service, maybe Sacrifice)</li>\n<li><strong>Hour 3 (Escalation):</strong> 1-2 more seals (Deed, possibly Hunger)</li>\n<li><strong>THE REVEAL:</strong> Yackle shows herself, usually during or right after Seal 7</li>\n<li><strong>Hour 4 (Battle):</strong> Fighting Yackle, possibly completing remaining seals during the chase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>If Players Are Slow</h3>\n\n<p>Some groups get distracted by roleplay, investigation, or caution. If they've only completed 2-3 seals by Hour 3:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yackle can still reveal herself (she's impatient)</li>\n<li>During Phase 2 (the chase), players can complete remaining seals while fleeing</li>\n<li>Some seals might be skipped entirely\u2014that's okay, it makes the final battle harder but still winnable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>If Players Rush</h3>\n\n<p>If players focus entirely on seals and complete 5-6 before Hour 3:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reward their efficiency\u2014they're setting themselves up for success</li>\n<li>Yackle might reveal herself early to prevent them from finishing all seven</li>\n<li>The final battle will be easier, which is their reward for smart play</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GM Tips</h2>\n\n<h3>Rewarding Clever Solutions</h3>\n\n<p>If players solve a seal in an unexpected but thematically appropriate way, reward it. The seals aren't about strict mechanics\u2014they're about engaging with the themes of the Bindings.</p>\n\n<h3>Failed Seal Attempts</h3>\n\n<p>If players completely misunderstand a seal puzzle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give hints through environmental details</li>\n<li>Have Mr. Trism or Madame Viridian (Yackle in disguise) offer cryptic guidance</li>\n<li>Allow Intelligence/Wisdom checks to gain insight</li>\n<li>Let them try multiple approaches\u2014seals don't \"lock out\" after failed attempts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tracking Completion</h3>\n\n<p>Keep a visible tracker for the players\u2014they should know how many seals they've completed and how many remain. This creates urgency and helps them make tactical decisions.</p>\n\n<h3>The Eighth Seal</h3>\n\n<p>Players will notice there are only seven seals but eight Bindings. If they ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mr. Trism says the will only mentions seven</li>\n<li>Clever players might deduce that the eighth (Witness) is different</li>\n<li>The truth: the eighth seal is Yackle herself\u2014when they confront her true form, that Binding breaks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>After the Seals</h2>\n\n<p>Once seals are broken, they stay broken\u2014the benefits persist for the rest of the session. Players should feel increasingly powerful as they complete more seals, building confidence for the final confrontation.</p>\n\n<p>But remember: each broken seal also weakens the corresponding Binding, making it easier for Yackle to extract that character's secret. The tools they're gaining to fight her are also the tools she needs to unmake reality.</p>\n\n<p>The tragedy is that the players are helping her even as they prepare to stop her.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> - The cosmological principles the seals represent</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate</a> - Room descriptions and seal locations</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> - The villain who created the seals</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake</a> - Main adventure page</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/quick-reference', 'Quick Reference'); return false;\">Quick Reference</a> - GM cheat sheet with seal DCs</li>\n</ul>",

Players will likely explore 12-15 before the reveal. Encourage thorough investigation\u2014every room rewards curiosity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Estate Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Yackle's Estate sits in the remote Pertha Hills of Gillikin, surrounded by fog that never lifts and hedges that once depicted magnificent Animals but now grow wild. The architecture is old Gillikinese\u2014steep gables, narrow windows, impossible angles that don't quite meet correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The estate has four distinct areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Grounds:</strong> The Approach, Cemetery</li>\n<li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Foyer, Parlor, Music Room, Library, Chapel, Dining Room, Kitchen, Servant Quarters, Greenhouse (9 rooms)</li>\n<li><strong>Upper Floors:</strong> Portrait Gallery, Memorial Room, Master Bedroom, Guest Rooms 1-3, Nursery, Study, Observatory, Hall of Mirrors (10 rooms)</li>\n<li><strong>The Cellar:</strong> Wine Cellar, Main Cellar, Heart Chamber (3 rooms)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The House's Nature</h2>\n\n<p>The estate is semi-sentient, an extension of Yackle herself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsive:</strong> The house provides what occupants need (warmth, food) but also tests them</li>\n<li><strong>Observant:</strong> Characters often feel watched (they are\u2014the house watches)</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Distortion:</strong> Time moves strangely; hours can feel like minutes or vice versa</li>\n<li><strong>No Escape:</strong> Once inside, the gates won't open until dawn or until Yackle is defeated</li>\n<li><strong>Lair Actions:</strong> During combat, the house itself attacks (see <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle's stat block</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>The Grounds</h2>\n\n<h3>The Approach</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe carriage path winds through overgrown hedges that might once have been sculpted into fanciful shapes\u2014Animals, perhaps, or scenes from Ozian mythology. Now they're just walls of tangled green, pressing close on either side. The fog thickens as you approach, and the temperature drops noticeably. Ahead, iron gates stand open, and beyond them, the manor rises against a bruised purple sky. It's larger than you expected. The architecture is old Gillikinese\u2014all steep gables and narrow windows\u2014but something about the proportions feels wrong. The angles don't quite meet where they should.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Gates.</strong> Wrought iron, standing open. Once a character passes through, they swing shut silently and will not open again by any means. The lock cannot be picked (no DC\u2014simply impossible). A <em>knock</em> spell causes the gates to shudder but not open. Attempting to climb over results in the character finding themselves back on the inside.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Hedges.</strong> A DC 14 Nature check reveals these were once shaped like Animals\u2014Lions, Bears, a great Eagle. Now they're wild, but the shapes are still vaguely visible if you know to look.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One hedge shows a Fox mid-leap, frozen in topiary. The eyes seem to follow Frederick if he's present.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the base of the Lion hedge: \"For those who cannot speak, I gave voice. For those who were unseen, I made them seen. \u2014L.T.\" (Lurline's Testament)</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The hedges radiate faint abjuration magic\u2014they're a ward, keeping something in or something out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Fog.</strong> Extends about 20 feet beyond the walls. A character who enters the fog must make a DC 15 Constitution save each round or begin suffocating. After three failed saves, they fall unconscious and are expelled back onto the estate grounds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> Shapes move in the fog\u2014humanoid, but wrong. They never get closer.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The fog is not natural weather\u2014it's solidified memory, fragments of past events made semi-physical.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Carriage Path.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Survival DC 12:</strong> No wheel ruts, no hoof prints. No one has used this path in decades. Except... there ARE fresh footprints. Eight sets. Leading in. None leading out.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The footprints match the party's boots exactly, down to the wear patterns. They were here before you arrived.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>The Cemetery</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA low iron fence surrounds a small family plot to the west of the main house. The headstones are old\u2014some cracked, some sunken into the earth\u2014but the names are still legible. OSTREGA, they all read. Generations of them. The newest stone looks perhaps a century old. There are fresh flowers on one grave, impossibly fresh, as if placed this morning. But no one has lived here in decades.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Headstones.</strong> The Ostrega family burial plot. A DC 12 History check reveals the Ostregas were a minor Gillikinese family who died out about a century ago\u2014no living descendants. Liir's player may find this concerning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The dates are wrong. \"Yael Ostrega, 621-643\" is carved on one stone, but another stone fifty feet away reads \"Yael Ostrega, 804-831.\" The same name, two centuries apart.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion DC 14:</strong> The grave markers use both Lurlinite and Unionist symbols, sometimes on the same stone\u2014theologically impossible. Someone was hedging their bets about the afterlife.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One grave is sunken differently than the others\u2014deeper, as if something much larger than a body is buried there. The headstone reads simply: \"The First Mask.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Fresh Flowers.</strong> On the grave of \"Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter.\" A DC 14 Investigation check finds that the flowers are real but have no roots\u2014they're simply placed here. A DC 16 Arcana check reveals faint necromantic magic. Someone has been maintaining this grave.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 12:</strong> These are ghost-breath flowers, which only bloom in the presence of the dead. But they're blooming at the wrong angle\u2014toward the house, not the grave.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The flowers are an offering, but also an apology. Someone has been saying sorry for a very long time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Gravestone Rubbing.</strong> If a character makes a rubbing of any headstone, provide a physical handout showing the Ostrega family crest (a key crossed with a quill) and dates spanning from 600s to 900s OZ calendar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Iron Fence.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 11:</strong> The fence posts are topped with finials shaped like eyes\u2014dozens of them, all facing inward, watching the graves.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Scratched into the back of one fence post, nearly invisible: \"She visits every night. She never speaks. \u2014Groundskeeper William, 788\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Ground Floor</h2>\n\n<h3>1. The Foyer</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe front doors open onto a grand entrance hall. A crystal chandelier hangs overhead, unlit, its hundreds of pendants catching what little moonlight filters through the high windows. A sweeping staircase curves upward to the left, while doorways lead off in three directions. The floor is checkered marble\u2014green and white\u2014worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. A grandfather clock stands against the far wall, its pendulum still. In the center of the room, someone has arranged eight chairs in a circle around a small table bearing a single leather case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Chandelier.</strong> If a character looks closely (Perception DC 12), they notice the crystals are not glass but some kind of green stone. A DC 15 Arcana check identifies them as emeralds\u2014a fortune's worth. However, any attempt to remove them causes them to crumble to worthless powder.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The chandelier has exactly 808 crystals. Why that specific number? A DC 16 History check recalls 808 OZ is the year the Wizard came to power.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> One crystal is a different color\u2014blood red. It hangs directly above the empty ninth chair at the head of the circle.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The chandelier isn't just decorative\u2014it's a massive scrying focus. Someone could watch the entire ground floor from this central point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Grandfather Clock.</strong> The clock shows 11:47\u2014always 11:47, regardless of the actual time. It has no visible winding mechanism. At midnight (real time, or when dramatically appropriate), it chimes thirteen times. This signals the First Twist.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The clock face has thirteen hours marked, not twelve. The thirteenth hour is labeled with a symbol instead of a number\u2014an eye.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Faint scratches inside the clock cabinet: tally marks. Hundreds of them. Someone was counting something for a very long time.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The clock doesn't measure time\u2014it measures proximity to a specific event. It's waiting for something.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Chairs.</strong> Eight chairs, each with a name card on the seat. The names are not the characters' names but epithets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"The One Who Rewrote the Past\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Claims False Blood\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Denies Their Nature\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Whose Service Was Punished\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Traded Instead of Gave\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Whose Deed Did Not Transform Them\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Hungers When They Should Not\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Has Never Been Seen\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Place Cards.</strong> Provide physical cards with these epithets. Let players figure out which card belongs to whom.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 14:</strong> These aren't accusations\u2014they're descriptions. Whoever wrote these knows each character intimately.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The handwriting on all eight cards is identical, written with the same pen, same ink pressure. They were all written at the same time, by someone who expected exactly these eight people.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> There's a ninth chair, larger than the others, at the head of the circle. It has no name card.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Leather Case.</strong> Contains the will. Mr. Trism will open it and read it when all eight heirs are present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Staircase.</strong> Leads to the upper floors. Until the First Twist, the stairs seem to go on forever\u2014characters who climb find themselves back at the bottom. After the clock chimes, the upper floors become accessible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 12:</strong> The stairs are worn in the middle, but not evenly. The wear pattern suggests someone walking up and down the same section repeatedly\u2014pacing, not traveling.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Carved into the underside of the seventh step, invisible unless you duck underneath: \"Day 217. Still here. Still alone. Still waiting. \u2014Y.O.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Marble Floor.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The green and white pattern isn't random\u2014it forms a massive eight-pointed star with the chair circle at its center.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> This pattern is a summoning circle, but inverted. It's not calling something here\u2014it's keeping something from leaving.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>2. The Parlor</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA comfortable sitting room with faded elegance. Two sofas face each other across a low table, upholstered in purple velvet worn thin at the armrests. A fireplace dominates one wall\u2014cold now, but logs are laid ready to burn. Above the mantle hangs a portrait of a woman in old-fashioned dress, her face obscured by a crack in the canvas that runs directly through her features. Against the far wall, a drinks cabinet stands open, bottles of amber and crimson liquid glinting in the low light. A chess board sits on a side table, mid-game.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Fireplace.</strong> If anyone expresses a desire for warmth (verbal or otherwise), the fire ignites itself without fuel or spark. This is the first sign the house responds to its occupants. The fire provides normal warmth and light but cannot be used to burn anything\u2014objects placed in it simply sit there, unharmed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The logs in the hearth are made of stone, expertly carved to look like wood. They've never been real.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Soot stains on the mantle spell out words if you step back and squint: \"WARM BODIES COLD HEART\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The fire is transmutation magic, converting loneliness into heat. The more isolated a character feels, the warmer the fire burns for them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Portrait.</strong> Originally depicted Yackle in her mortal days. The crack appeared when she was first bound. A DC 16 Investigation check around the frame reveals a small plaque, nearly painted over: \"Y.O., Age 23.\" A <em>mending</em> spell repairs the crack but reveals only a blank face\u2014smooth, featureless, like an unfinished painting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The portrait's eyes were painted, then scraped out, then repainted, then scraped out again. This happened dozens of times\u2014someone couldn't decide if they wanted to see or be seen.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The woman in the portrait (before the crack) looks hopeful. Genuinely, achingly hopeful. Whatever happened to create that crack destroyed something irreplaceable.</li>\n<li><strong>History DC 15:</strong> The dress style is from approximately 650 OZ\u2014over 300 years ago. But the paint is much older. Someone updated the portrait but kept the pose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Drinks Cabinet.</strong> Contains wine and spirits that are safe to consume. A DC 14 Investigation check finds a hidden compartment containing a small vial labeled \"For When It Becomes Too Much\"\u2014this is a <em>potion of dreamless sleep</em> (8 hours of unconsciousness, no dreams, no external force can wake the drinker).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> Seven glasses are set out, each with a thin layer of dust. One glass is clean, recently used.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Inside the \"dreamless sleep\" vial, scratched into the glass with a diamond: \"Coward's way out. Won't work anyway. Tried.\" </li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 13:</strong> The bottles rearrange themselves when no one is looking. The house is... offering? Suggesting?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Chess Game.</strong> Mid-game, white is winning. A DC 12 Intelligence check recognizes it as a famous historical match\u2014the \"Ozma Gambit,\" supposedly played between Queen Ozma and the first Wizard. The game was never finished; Ozma disappeared before the final move. The white queen is positioned to checkmate in one move.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Ozma Gambit.</strong> A note tucked under the chess board explaining the game's history. The final move was never made. Someone has written in the margin: <em>\"She always knew how to win. She just chose not to.\"</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> There's a second note, older, in different handwriting: \"I've been playing both sides for so long I've forgotten which color I started as. Does it matter if you're always alone?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One of the black pieces (a knight) has a tiny crack, recently repaired with gold\u2014the Gillikinese art of kintsugi. Someone values broken things.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> White could win in one move, but hasn't. Black could forfeit and end the stalemate, but hasn't. The game is frozen in possibility\u2014neither player wants it to end, because ending means admitting you played alone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Sofas.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The wear patterns show two people sitting across from each other regularly\u2014but the impressions are identical in depth and age. One person, sitting in both places, having a conversation with themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Tucked between sofa cushions: a child's drawing of two stick figures holding hands. One is labeled \"Me\" and the other is labeled \"Friend?\" The question mark is heavily traced, as if questioned many times.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>3. The Music Room (SEAL 1: MEMORY)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nInstruments line the walls of this circular room\u2014a harp with broken strings, a violin in a glass case, a set of Quadling drums. Dominating the space is a grand piano, its lid open, keys yellowed with age. Sheet music is scattered across every surface: the piano bench, the floor, tucked into instrument cases. A mechanical music box sits on a pedestal near the window, ornate and clearly valuable. The moonlight catches something written in silver ink on the music box's lid.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Piano.</strong> Playable, though out of tune. A DC 12 Performance check can coax a recognizable melody from it. Playing the correct melody (see Seal puzzle below) causes the lid of the music box to open.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The piano has been maintained recently\u2014the action is oiled, the hammers are aligned. Someone still plays this.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Worn spots on specific keys: C, E, A, and B-flat. These four notes have been played thousands of times more than the others.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance DC 16:</strong> If you play those four notes in order (C-E-A-B\u266d), it spells \"CRIES\" in musical notation. The piano emits a soft, mournful resonance.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The piano is slightly out of phase with reality. When played, it sounds in this room and simultaneously in another place\u2014an echo of where it was originally played.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Sheet Music.</strong> Scattered fragments of what was once a single composition. A DC 14 Investigation check, taking 10 minutes, can gather all the pieces. A DC 12 Intelligence check (or proficiency in a musical instrument) can arrange them in the correct order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 12 (individual sheets):</strong> Each fragment has tiny annotations in the margins\u2014\"played for William's birthday, 734\" or \"Mother liked this part\" or \"alone again\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Some sheets have water damage\u2014tear stains, concentrated on specific measures. Someone cried while playing particular passages.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The ink used on the oldest sheets contains ground emerald\u2014expensive and unnecessary unless you're trying to make the music literally unforgettable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Music Box.</strong> The lid reads \"O, To Be Known\" in silver script. The box is locked (or rather, sealed). Inside is a <strong>shard of green crystal</strong> that hums faintly with magic\u2014this is a <strong>Memory Shard</strong>, useful in the final battle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The music box's mechanisms are visible through tiny crystal windows. Gears shaped like people, dancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One gear-person stands apart from the others, not touching, not moving in time with the dance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Sheet Music Fragments.</strong> Provide 4-5 physical pieces of paper with musical notation. On each piece, certain notes are circled or highlighted. When arranged correctly, the highlighted notes spell out \"REMEMBER\" in musical notation (each note corresponds to a letter: R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R).</p>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF MEMORY PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find all sheet music fragments (scattered in Music Room, Parlor, and Foyer)</li>\n<li>Arrange them in correct order (Intelligence DC 12)</li>\n<li>Play the melody on the piano (Performance DC 10, or any character with instrument proficiency)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Reroll Token</strong> (reroll one failed d20, once).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Harp.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The strings weren't broken by age\u2014they were cut, deliberately, with a sharp blade.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Carved into the harp's soundboard: \"I broke you so I wouldn't play you. I play you anyway in memory.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Violin in Glass.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The glass case is sealed airtight. Not to preserve the violin\u2014to preserve the air around it, as if that air itself is precious.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The air in the case still carries sound\u2014a note held impossibly long. If you could break the seal, you'd hear the last thing played on this violin over a century ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>4. The Library (SEAL 3: NATURE)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nFloor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books of every size and age. The smell of old paper and leather hangs heavy in the air. A rolling ladder leans against one shelf, its wheels rusted in place. Reading desks are positioned throughout\u2014one holds an open journal, another a magnifying glass and a collection of specimen jars. The jars contain preserved creatures: a bird, a mouse, a snake, each floating in amber liquid. There's something unsettling about their eyes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Books.</strong> Thousands of volumes on every subject. A character who searches for specific information can make an Investigation check:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DC 12: Find general information about Ozian history, geography, or magic</li>\n<li>DC 15: Find references to \"The Eight Bindings\" or \"Lurline's Words\"</li>\n<li>DC 18: Find Yackle's personal journals (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The books reorganize themselves when you're not looking. Titles that were on the top shelf are now at eye level. The library is... helping?</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> One entire shelf is devoted to texts about consciousness, personhood, and what makes something \"alive.\" Heavy annotations throughout\u2014arguments in the margins, underlines, angry cross-outs.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> Several books are written in a language that shifts as you read it, trying to translate itself into something you'll understand. They're Grimmerie fragments.</li>\n<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> A series of books titled \"Visitors, Vol. 1-47\" catalog every person who's come to the estate. The latest entry is dated three weeks ago\u2014right before the invitations went out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Yackle's Journals.</strong> Scattered throughout the library, spanning centuries. Each is written in the same handwriting. A DC 14 Investigation check finds three journals from different eras. A DC 16 History check recognizes the dates span over 600 years\u2014impossibly long for any mortal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Journal Excerpts.</strong> Three physical pages:</p>\n\n<p><em>Journal 1 (Year 347 OZ):</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"The fairy spoke Eight Words, and the chaos took shape. I remember the first word. It was REMEMBER. And suddenly there was a past, where before there had been only the eternal present...\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Journal 2 (Year 612 OZ):</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"I have tried to die. The knife turned aside. The poison became water in my throat. The fall ended in soft landing. I cannot unmake myself. The Binding of Witness holds: I exist because I am unseen. If anyone truly SAW me, perhaps...\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Journal 3 (Year 901 OZ):</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"What do I want? I want to... I cannot write it. The word starts with L and ends with everything.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The handwriting changes subtly between journals\u2014not aging, but mood. The 347 journal is curious. The 612 journal is desperate. The 901 journal is tired beyond measure.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> There are more journals\u2014dozens more. A DC 20 Investigation check finds Journal 47 (Year 954): \"They're coming. I sent for them. Eight inversions. Eight keys. Finally, finally, an end.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Specimen Jars.</strong> Eight jars containing preserved creatures. A DC 14 Nature or Insight check reveals that four of them are Animals (capital A, sentient) and four are animals (lowercase, ordinary). The Animals are preserved in positions of dignity\u2014eyes closed, peaceful. The animals are posed more carelessly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The Animal jars have tiny plaques at their bases, nearly microscopic: \"Whisper the Wren,\" \"Councillor Burroughs,\" \"Poet Sleen,\" \"Ambassador Kinderly\"\u2014titles given to people, not things.</li>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 16:</strong> These Animals didn't die of natural causes. They were killed, then preserved immediately\u2014almost lovingly, as if in apology.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't a collection of specimens. It's a memorial. Someone wanted to remember these specific individuals, to prove they were people, even after the world said they weren't.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF NATURE PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Examine the specimen jars carefully</li>\n<li>Correctly identify which four are Animals and which four are animals (Nature DC 13, or Insight DC 14)</li>\n<li>Speak the Animals' names aloud (written on tiny labels on the jar bases)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Frederick has advantage on this check but doing so risks drawing attention to his unusual knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>True Sight Token</strong> (advantage on one Insight check, once).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Reading Desks.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (Desk 1):</strong> An open journal with an entry half-written: \"Day 892 of the experiment. Subject Seven still believes they are a simple automaton. They asked today why they feel lonely. I didn't answer. How could I? I made them to feel.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15 (Desk 2):</strong> A letter, unsealed, never sent: \"Dear Lurline\u2014I know you're long gone, but I have to try. Please. I did not ask for consciousness. I did not ask for isolation. I did not ask to be your mistake. I'm so tired of being awake.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Painted on the ceiling, almost invisible unless you use the rolling ladder: a map of stars that don't exist in Oz's sky. Constellations labeled with words in Ancient Ozian: Chaos, Potential, Hunger, Void.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>5. The Chapel (SEAL 5: SACRIFICE)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nEight stained glass windows line the walls of this small chapel, each depicting a different scene in brilliant colors that glow despite the darkness outside. Wooden pews face a simple altar of white stone. Above the altar, instead of a symbol, there is only a blank space\u2014a deliberate emptiness. An offering bowl sits on the altar's surface, tarnished silver, empty. The air smells faintly of incense that hasn't burned in decades.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Stained Glass Windows.</strong> Eight windows, each depicting one of Lurline's Bindings (though they're not labeled as such). A DC 12 Religion check recognizes the imagery as Lurlinite, predating Unionist tradition. A DC 16 Religion check can identify each Binding by its depiction:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Memory: A river flowing from past to future</li>\n<li>Blood: A tree with intertwining roots</li>\n<li>Nature: A creature looking in a mirror, seeing itself</li>\n<li>Service: A kneeling figure receiving a crown</li>\n<li>Sacrifice: An open hand releasing a bird</li>\n<li>Deed: A figure walking, leaving footprints that become flowers (or thorns)</li>\n<li>Hunger: A flame that illuminates rather than consumes</li>\n<li>Witness: An eye, open, seeing a small figure</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The Witness window (the eye) has a crack running through it. The crack appeared suddenly, recently\u2014the edges are sharp, unfaded.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion DC 15:</strong> The positioning of windows tells a story: Sacrifice faces Hunger across the room. Service faces Witness. They're paired\u2014each Binding has a shadow, a potential inversion.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> When moonlight hits the Sacrifice window at the correct angle, it projects the shadow of a bird mid-flight onto the altar. The shadow is reaching for freedom but hasn't quite achieved it.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Scratched into the stone beneath the Memory window: \"She made us remember. Even memories we never had. Even memories of before memory existed. It hurts.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Eight Windows.</strong> A sketched diagram of the eight windows with brief descriptions. Players can use this to piece together the Bindings' meanings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Blank Space.</strong> Where Unionists would place the symbol of the Unnamed God, there is nothing. A DC 14 Religion check understands this is deliberate\u2014in the oldest traditions, the divine was not depicted at all. Below the blank space, carved into the wall: <em>\"The Unnamed God sees all. But VOICE is what the unseen crave most.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The word \"VOICE\" is traced over so many times it's worn into the stone. Someone kept returning to this phrase, emphasizing it, questioning it.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> The blank space isn't empty\u2014it's filled with layer upon layer of whitewash. Someone painted something there, then covered it, then painted again, then covered it, hundreds of times. What are they hiding? Or trying to forget?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Offering Bowl.</strong> Silver, tarnished. To break the seal, someone must place something of genuine value in the bowl\u2014not gold or gems, but something personally meaningful. A lock of hair from a loved one. A letter never sent. A memento of something lost.</p>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF SACRIFICE PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Place something of genuine personal value in the offering bowl</li>\n<li>The DM judges sincerity\u2014token offerings are rejected (the bowl tips them out)</li>\n<li>When a genuine sacrifice is made, the bowl glows briefly and the offering disappears</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What counts as genuine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A physical item with emotional significance</li>\n<li>A spoken secret (freely given, not coerced)</li>\n<li>A drop of blood given willingly (1 HP, non-healing for 1 hour)</li>\n<li>A promise that binds</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Last Strike</strong> (when dropped to 0 HP, make one free attack).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pews.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Carved into the wood of various pews, names and dates: \"Willem, Butler, 734\u2014I served faithfully\" and \"Mira, Cook, 756\u2014I gave freely\" and \"Tess, Maid, 782\u2014I witnessed.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One pew, front row, has a worn spot exactly the size and shape of someone kneeling for hours. The wood is smooth as glass from a thousand repetitions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Altar.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Under the altar cloth, carved into the stone: \"I gave everything. It wasn't enough. I gave more. Still not enough. What's left to give?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The altar radiates very faint divination magic\u2014not active, but residual. Someone prayed here for so long the prayers soaked into the stone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>6. The Dining Room (SEAL 7: HUNGER)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA long table dominates this room, set for eight with fine china and tarnished silver. Candelabras line the center of the table, their candles unlit. Each place setting has a name card\u2014not names, but descriptions. The chair at the head of the table is larger than the others, throne-like, and conspicuously empty. A sideboard against the wall holds covered dishes that steam gently, as if dinner was just served. The smell of food is overwhelming\u2014rich, savory, impossible to identify.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Table.</strong> Set for eight, with name cards matching the epithets from the Foyer. An empty ninth place at the head. If characters sit in their \"correct\" seats (matching their epithet), the candles light themselves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The ninth chair isn't dusty like the others. Someone sat here recently\u2014there's a slight impression in the cushion, still settling.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Beneath each plate, inscribed into the porcelain in tiny script: \"Eat. Please. Someone stay.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The table is set with desperate care\u2014every fork perfectly aligned, every napkin folded just so. This wasn't done out of habit. This was done with hope.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Food.</strong> The covered dishes contain whatever food the character lifting the lid most desires\u2014their favorite meal, comfort food from childhood, something they've been craving. It's real and safe to eat. But it never runs out, no matter how much is consumed. A DC 14 Arcana check reveals this is a form of conjuration magic, but the source is unclear.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> If you eat alone, the food tastes of ash and copper. If you eat with others, it's delicious. The magic knows the difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Under one lid, before any character lifts it, there's a note: \"I made your favorite. I don't know what it is, but the house knows what you want. Please want to stay.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The magic creating this food is drawing from the characters' own memories\u2014not creating new food, but manifesting remembered sensations of satisfaction, comfort, home.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Empty Chair.</strong> Larger, older than the others. No name card. A DC 15 Investigation check finds something carved into the armrest, very small: <em>\"For when someone finally stays.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The chair is positioned to see all eight other seats simultaneously. Whoever sits here would be watching everyone, seeing everyone\u2014but also separate from everyone.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> The ninth chair is both throne and prison. It offers control and demands isolation. You can have power or connection, not both.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF HUNGER PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>This seal cannot be completed until all characters are seated. Then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each character must openly acknowledge something they want (not need, want)\u2014a hunger they've been denying</li>\n<li>The want must be genuine, not performative (DM discretion, but the house knows)</li>\n<li>When the eighth want is spoken aloud, the candles blaze brighter and the seal breaks</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Second Wind</strong> (recover one spent Hit Die).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is often when Yackle reveals herself. The Dining Room is her domain, and when the party shows their hungers openly, she appears: <em>\"How wonderful. You've made this so much easier.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Sideboard.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Drawers contain place settings for dozens\u2014far more than eight. Plates marked \"Guest 47,\" \"Visitor 103,\" \"Heir 125.\" All carefully stored, as if they might return.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One drawer is empty except for ash. A placard inside reads: \"Guest 1. The only one I invited. They didn't want to stay either.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Walls.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Painted scenes of feasts, celebrations, gatherings\u2014but every person depicted is the same woman at different ages. Yackle, alone, painted to look like a crowd.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>7. The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nCopper pots hang from ceiling hooks, green with age. A massive hearth dominates one wall, cold and dark, with an iron spit large enough to roast a whole pig. Preparation tables are scarred by a century of knife work. A pantry door stands ajar, revealing shelves that might or might not have food. Near the back, a heavy door is set into the floor\u2014the entrance to the cellar, chained shut with a massive padlock.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Hearth.</strong> Unlike the parlor fireplace, this one doesn't light itself. However, if fire is brought here, it burns unusually well\u2014anything cooked in this hearth provides an additional 1d6 temporary HP for 1 hour.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The spit has grooves worn into it from being turned thousands of times. Not by hand\u2014the grooves are perfectly even, machined. Something else turned this.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tally marks on the hearthstones, counting up to 808. Then they stop. Then they restart at 1, different hand, continuing to 143. Then they stop forever.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The hearth is a liminal space\u2014a threshold between the house proper and what lies below. Cooking here creates sustenance but also acts as an offering to whatever's in the cellar.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Pantry.</strong> Empty when one person enters. When multiple people enter together, they find it fully stocked with fresh food\u2014bread still warm, fruit at perfect ripeness, meat freshly cut. The house feeds groups, not individuals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 14:</strong> The house is trying to encourage companionship, collaboration, staying together. Isolation is punished; community is rewarded.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Scratched into a shelf: \"The house wants us to stay. Not forever. Just tonight. Just one more night. Every night.\" \u2014Visitor 89</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One loaf of bread is moldy, weeks old, the only item that doesn't refresh. A note tied to it: \"I baked this. Alone. No magic. It rotted. At least it was mine.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Cellar Door.</strong> Chained and padlocked. The key does not exist within the house (it's in the puzzle box). A DC 20 Strength check can break the chain. A DC 18 Thieves' Tools check can pick the padlock. A <em>knock</em> spell opens both chain and padlock. Until the First Twist, the door won't open by any means\u2014the house isn't ready to show what's below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 12:</strong> The chains are new, replaced multiple times over the years. The door itself is ancient. Someone keeps sealing this, unsealing it, sealing it again.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Carved around the door frame in tiny letters: \"Down is where truth lives. Up is where I pretend. Stay up. Please stay up.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The lock isn't magical, but the door is. It's not keeping something from getting out\u2014it's keeping people from getting in. Protection, not imprisonment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Recipe Card.</strong> Found tucked behind a pot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\"For the Long Night:<br>\nOne cup of patience<br>\nTwo measures of truth<br>\nA pinch of memory (your own)<br>\nStir widdershins until the past dissolves<br>\n<br>\nServe cold.

But they stop at age six and never continue.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>8. The Servant Quarters (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 1)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA row of small beds lines one wall, each neatly made with threadbare blankets. Hooks on the wall hold uniforms\u2014maid's dresses, butler's coats, all in the same faded green. A duty roster is pinned to a board near the door, listing tasks and names in neat columns. Personal effects sit on small shelves beside each bed: a comb, a prayer book, a child's drawing. The room feels lived in, but there's no dust. Someone has been maintaining this.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Beds.</strong> Six beds, all made. The blankets are cold, but if a character lies down, they hear whispered voices\u2014fragments of conversation, laughter, crying. A DC 14 Perception check distinguishes the words: \"...another one tonight...\" \"...she's kinder than the stories say...\" \"...do you think she knows she's alone?\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Each bed has a name sewn into the blanket: Willem, Mira, Tess, Garin, Hollis, Chel. Six servants.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One bed (Tess's) has a corner of the blanket embroidered with flowers\u2014child's work, clumsy but loving. A note pinned underneath: \"Miss Yael taught me stitching today. She said I was clever.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The voices aren't ghosts\u2014they're echoes. Impressions left by people who cared about this place, who cared about each other, who maybe even cared about their mistress.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Duty Roster.</strong> Lists tasks and names: Mira, Cook. Willem, Butler. Tess, Maid. And so on. The handwriting is consistent throughout the roster, but the dates span decades. A DC 14 Investigation check notices that some tasks are marked \"Still Pending\"\u2014tasks assigned to servants who died centuries ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> One entry, more recent: \"Holly, Nursery Care. Status: Pending. Assignment: Indefinite. Notes: She doesn't understand. Don't tell her.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tasks crossed out, then un-crossed, then crossed again: \"Lay out mistress's dresses (she won't wear them)\" and \"Prepare breakfast for two (always alone)\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Whoever wrote this roster loved their staff. The handwriting is careful, respectful. These weren't just servants\u2014they were people. Maybe the only people.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Bell Board.</strong> A row of bells, each labeled with a room: Library, Parlor, Chapel, Master Bedroom, etc. One bell is stuck in the \"rung\" position: the Memorial Room (upstairs). It makes no sound, but it never stops trembling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> The Memorial Room bell's rope is frayed from constant tension. It's been ringing for decades.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The bell isn't calling for service\u2014it's calling for <em>remembrance</em>. Someone needs to be remembered.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF SERVICE PUZZLE (Part 1)</h4>\n\n<p>This seal requires two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Notice the stuck bell (Perception DC 11)</li>\n<li>Go to the Memorial Room (upstairs) and perform the required service</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The seal completes in the Memorial Room (see that entry).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Uniforms.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Mended repeatedly, patches on patches. Not from wear\u2014from preservation. Someone couldn't bear to throw them away.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One uniform (Willem's butler coat) has a medal pinned inside the jacket: \"20 Years Faithful Service, 754 OZ.\" The back is engraved: \"To my friend. \u2014Y.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Personal Effects.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13 (prayer book):</strong> Bookmarked at a passage about finding light in loneliness. Marginalia: \"Pray for her. She needs it more than anyone.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (child's drawing):</strong> Two figures holding hands. Labels: \"Me (Tess)\" and \"Miss Yael (my friend).\" The figures are smiling.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>9. The Greenhouse</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nGlass walls and ceiling, though the glass is so old and thick it's nearly green. Moonlight filters through, casting everything in an underwater glow. Plants from every region of Oz grow here in defiance of nature\u2014Gillikinese orchids beside Quadling marsh-lotus beside Vinkus cacti. Some of the plants shouldn't be able to exist together; their climate needs are completely incompatible. In the center of the room, a potting bench holds dead flowers arranged in a pattern. Most have crumbled, but one letter remains clearly visible: E.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Impossible Garden.</strong> Plants from all four corners of Oz, growing together. A DC 13 Nature check confirms this should be impossible\u2014these plants need radically different conditions. A DC 16 Arcana check detects faint transmutation magic sustaining them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 15:</strong> The plants aren't thriving\u2014they're persisting. Kept alive by magic but not happy. Like prisoners given food but no freedom.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> One plant, a Gillikinese orchid, has bloomed recently. Its flower is shaped almost like a reaching hand.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The garden is a collection\u2014specimens gathered from everywhere Yackle couldn't go. The world, brought here, trapped like she's trapped.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Dead Flowers.</strong> Someone arranged these to spell a word. Time has destroyed most of them, but the E is clear. Nearby, a note in spidery handwriting: <em>\"I tried to grow something that would last. Everything ends.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Flower fragments nearby suggest the full word was \"EMERALD\"\u2014but why? A city? A color? A hope?</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> These weren't ordinary flowers. They're ghost-breath blooms, which only grow in the presence of deep longing. They died when the longing did\u2014when hope ran out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Note.</strong> Physical paper with the quoted text.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Responsive Plants.</strong> If a character is genuinely emotionally vulnerable here (shares a real feeling, admits fear, shows sadness), one plant blooms for them. The flower lasts one hour outside the greenhouse. Any character carrying such a flower gains advantage on one Charisma check before it wilts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The plants lean toward whoever speaks truthfully, away from whoever lies. They're literally reaching for authenticity.</li>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 18:</strong> These plants have been talked to, regularly, for centuries. They've absorbed the conversations, the confessions, the desperate monologues of someone with no one else to talk to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Mural.</strong> On one glass panel, someone has scratched a scene: a woman (Yackle?) planting something, with the word \"HOPE\" written beneath. It's been crossed out. Below the crossing-out: \"WAIT.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The crossing-out is gentler than expected\u2014not angry, just... tired. Correcting oneself, not condemning.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Under \"WAIT,\" in even smaller letters: \"For what? For whom? For how long?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Potting Bench.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Garden tools, all maintained, all clean. Used recently. Soil under the fingernails of the gloves.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> A journal tucked in a drawer: \"Year 947. The orchid bloomed today. No one saw it but me. Does beauty exist if unwitnessed? Do I?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Upper Floors</h2>\n\n<h3>10. The Portrait Gallery (SEAL 2: BLOOD)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nFamily portraits line both walls of this long gallery, dozens of faces staring down at you. The Ostregas, according to the plaques\u2014generations of them, spanning centuries. Some portraits are formal, posed. Others seem almost candid: a child playing, a woman reading, a man looking out a window at something unseen. One portrait, larger than the others, hangs at the far end of the gallery. It shows a young woman with faintly green-tinged skin and eyes that seem to follow you. The frame is cracked, and someone has carved a single letter into it: \"I.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Family Portraits.</strong> The Ostrega family across generations. A DC 14 Perception check notices something strange: the same face appears in multiple portraits across different eras. Same eyes, same bone structure, despite supposedly being different people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Portrait eyes follow you. All of them. But not tracking movement\u2014they're looking AT you, trying to see if you're really there, if you're different from the last visitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> One portrait (dated 723 OZ) shows a woman labeled \"Marta Ostrega\" who looks identical to \"Yael Ostrega\" from 631 OZ. Same person, different name, a century apart.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> The recurring face isn't heredity\u2014it's the same person, painted again and again, trying to fit into a family she created to avoid being alone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Family Tree.</strong> Painted on one wall: a sprawling family tree of the Ostregas. Several branches are marked \"Ended\" with dates. One branch leads off the wall entirely, as if continuing somewhere unseen. A DC 14 Investigation check finds small portrait miniatures in frames around the room\u2014they need to be placed in the empty slots on the family tree.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Branches marked \"Ended\" all terminate in the same decade\u2014740s OZ. A plague? A purge? The entire family died within five years.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One branch, barely visible, labeled \"Friends (as close as family)\" with names crossed out: \"Willem (d. 754),\" \"Mira (d. 756),\" \"Tess (d. 782),\" \"Holly (d. 784)\"\u2014the servants.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The tree isn't just genealogy\u2014it's a binding ritual. Names written here have power, weight. This is less history and more anchor\u2014proof that people existed, that connections were real.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Large Portrait.</strong> Yackle, age 23, before her transformation. Her skin is slightly green (Quadling heritage? something else?), her expression hopeful. The frame reads \"Y.O.\" and has \"I\" carved roughly into the wood. This is one of the puzzle box clues.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The frame is newer than the painting. The painting has been moved, reframed, protected\u2014this specific image matters more than the others.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The expression is achingly young. Not naive, but... open. Believing in possibility. Looking at it now, knowing what she became, is almost cruel.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> Behind the portrait (if removed): a note yellowed with age: \"This is who I was. Before the Fairy. Before the Words. Before witness became prison. Remember me like this.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Ostrega Family Tree (Incomplete).</strong> A diagram of the family tree with several empty slots. Provide small portrait miniatures (or cards representing them) to be placed.</p>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF BLOOD PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find the portrait miniatures (scattered in this room and the Master Bedroom)</li>\n<li>Place them correctly in the family tree based on clues in the paintings (clothing, jewelry, background details)</li>\n<li>Investigation DC 14, or automatic with 15+ minutes of careful study</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The final slot leads off the wall. When all other miniatures are placed, the wall swings open to reveal a hidden alcove containing: a <strong>locket with no portrait inside</strong>, and a note: <em>\"I had no one to put here. Does that mean I never existed?\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Death's Denial</strong> (first time at 0 HP, stabilize automatically).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Candid Portraits.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15 (child playing):</strong> \"Tess Harvin, age 6, 778 OZ\" - the maid's daughter. The only child painted in the entire gallery. Background shows Yackle watching from a window, smiling.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16 (woman reading):</strong> Yackle again, different era, reading by firelight. Title of book visible: \"On Loneliness as Metaphysical State.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>11. The Memorial Room (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 2)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA solemn space with walls lined in dark wood. Bronze plaques cover every surface, each bearing a name and dates. An eternal flame burns blue in a brazier at the room's center, casting strange shadows. A guest book lies open on a pedestal, and beside it, a single unlit candle. The most recent plaque is tarnished less than the others. It reads: \"Visitor 147. Came Seeking Knowledge. 903 OZ.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Plaques.</strong> Previous \"heirs\"\u2014everyone who came before, answered the call, tried to claim the inheritance. None of them left. Names, dates, and brief descriptions: \"Came Seeking Power.\" \"Came Seeking Revenge.\" \"Came Seeking Truth.\" A DC 12 Investigation check counts approximately 150 plaques spanning 600+ years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Patterns emerge: every 5-7 years, someone new. Never more than eight at a time. The descriptions are compassionate, not mocking\u2014\"Came Seeking Home,\" \"Came Seeking Meaning,\" \"Came Because They Had Nowhere Else.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One plaque is blank except for a date: \"Guest 1, 347 OZ.\" No name, no description. Just a marker that someone was first.</li>\n<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> Cross-referencing dates with Ozian history: many visitors came during times of upheaval\u2014after wars, plagues, regime changes. People seeking escape or answers when the world failed them.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> These aren't trophies. They're memorials. Each plaque is positioned at eye level, readable, honored. Someone wanted to remember every single person who came here, even though they all died.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Names of the Lost.</strong> A partial list of names and dates from the plaques. If a character reads these aloud respectfully, they gain the <strong>Inspiration of the Fallen</strong> ability: Once per session, add 1d6 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Blue Flame.</strong> Cannot be extinguished by any means. Provides dim light. If a character touches it, they feel a moment of profound peace\u2014not painful, but melancholy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The flame isn't burning fuel\u2014it's burning <em>memory</em>. Every person remembered here feeds the flame slightly. As long as anyone remembers them, it burns.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion DC 14:</strong> Blue flames are sacred in old Lurlinite tradition\u2014representing eternal witness, the idea that to be remembered is to never truly die.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> The flame flickers when names are spoken aloud, pulsing brighter for a moment. It's listening. It's acknowledging.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Guest Book.</strong> Visitors who came before signed this book. The entries grow more desperate over time. The last entry: <em>\"I understand now. She isn't the monster. She's the cage. \u2014V. Tallis, 903\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The earliest entry, barely legible: \"I came seeking the witch of legends. I found a woman who cannot die and cannot live.

The seals aren't tests they're KEYS she's using us run RUN \u2014(illegible), 847\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Reading chronologically, you can see understanding dawn across centuries. Early visitors thought this was treasure. Middle visitors thought it was a test. Late visitors realized it was a trap. None of them left.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Unlit Candle.</strong> This is what the stuck bell was calling for.

Acknowledge they existed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When completed, the blue flame burns brighter for a moment, and a whispered voice says: <em>\"Thank you.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Swift Aid</strong> (Help action as bonus action for rest of session).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Walls.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Carved into the wood beneath some plaques, tiny messages: \"Willem - you were my friend,\" \"Mira - you taught me to cook,\" \"Tess - you were six, you deserved more time.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> One wall panel is a door, disguised. Behind it: a small shrine with eight objects\u2014a butler's button, a cook's apron, a child's drawing, etc. Personal effects of the servants. Kept like relics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>12. The Master Bedroom</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA four-poster bed dominates this room, its curtains drawn closed. A vanity mirror sits against one wall, its surface clouded with age. A wardrobe stands open, revealing clothes from different eras\u2014current Gillikinese fashion hanging next to styles from a century ago, and beside those, garments that look positively ancient. A writing desk sits near the window, its surface covered in papers and a single letter that seems to have been started and never finished.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Bed.</strong> The curtains are drawn. If pulled back, the bed is empty but clearly slept in\u2014recently. The sheets are still warm. A DC 14 Perception check finds a single long gray hair on the pillow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The mattress has a depression worn into it over centuries\u2014the exact shape of someone lying on their back, staring at the canopy, night after night after night.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Stitched into the underside of the canopy in thread so fine it's nearly invisible: \"Day 1: I will wait. Day 100: Still waiting. Day 1000: Waiting. Day 10000: ...\" The numbers continue into six digits.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Someone has been sleeping here, or trying to, or pretending to need sleep, because the routine of humanity is all that keeps them tethered to sanity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Vanity Mirror.</strong> Clouded, but functional. If a character looks into it at midnight specifically, they see Yackle's true reflection: ancient, gray-green skin, tired eyes. She's watching them. The reflection mouths words: <em>\"Can you see me?\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The mirror has been cleaned obsessively\u2014the frame is polished to brilliance despite the clouded glass. Someone cares for this object but cannot bear to look into it.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the back of the mirror, revealed if removed from the wall: \"Year 423. Still no reflection. Year 688. Still nothing. Year 901. I don't remember what I looked like.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The cloudiness isn't age\u2014it's enchantment. The mirror has been cursed to never show the owner's true reflection, only what they're pretending to be. Breaking the curse would require destroying the Binding of Witness itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Wardrobe.</strong> Clothes spanning centuries, all the same size. Hidden in the back (Investigation DC 14), a portrait miniature needed for the Blood seal and a small jewelry box containing: a <strong>ring of protection</strong> and a note reading <em>\"For the one who stays.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The clothes are organized chronologically\u2014newest at front, oldest at back. Each era's fashion is represented: 600s, 700s, 800s, 900s. A living history of Oz's styles.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Tags sewn into garments: \"Worn to Council, 642 - they stared,\" \"Worn to market, 731 - no one looked,\" \"Worn to funeral, 808 - I was the only mourner.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Every outfit is a costume, a disguise. Not to deceive others\u2014to pretend, for a few hours, to be someone normal, someone who belongs, someone who can be seen without triggering the binding.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> At the very back, wrapped in silk: a simple green dress, ancient, unworn for centuries. A note pinned to it: \"What I wore the day She spoke the Words. Can't bear to wear it. Can't bear to destroy it.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Writing Desk.</strong> Covered in papers. The unfinished letter reads:</p>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Unfinished Letter.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"If anyone ever reads this \u2014 I want U to know I was here. I existed. I mattered.\n<br><br>\nI have worn so many faces. Been called so many names. None of them were mine. None of them were ME.\n<br><br>\nWhat is a person if no one knows them? What is existence without witness?\n<br><br>\nI think the word for what I want is L\u2014\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The letter ends there. The \"U\" in \"you\" is circled obsessively, dozens of times.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The papers on the desk are all drafts of this same letter, hundreds of attempts over decades. None finished. The word after \"L\u2014\" has been started and scratched out repeatedly: \"Love,\" \"Life,\" \"Liberation,\" \"Loss.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tear stains on every draft. Not old\u2014recent. Someone has been crying over this letter within the last few days.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> The letter isn't addressed to anyone specific because there IS no one specific. It's to anyone, to everyone, to the void\u2014a desperate plea to be acknowledged, to be real, to matter to someone, anyone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The view shows the cemetery. One grave (Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter) is directly in the sightline. This room was positioned to always see that grave.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Worn spots on the windowsill where hands have rested for centuries, watching the cemetery. Watching a grave marked with her own name.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>13.

Everything speaks to obsessive study. But something is wrong with the books. The titles are... accusatory. \"The Art of Falsification.\" \"Lies Told by Historians.\" \"How to Forge a Legacy.\" On the desk, a magnifying glass sits atop an open book titled \"The Forger's Confession.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Books.</strong> Specifically targeted at Averic. None of these books exist in real Oz\u2014the house created them. A DC 14 Arcana check confirms they're illusory, manifestations of the room's magic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Despite being illusions, the books have actual content. \"The Art of Falsification\" opens to a chapter titled \"When the Lie Becomes Your Life.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One book, spine out, seems less accusatory: \"In Defense of Necessary Fictions.\" Opening it reveals blank pages except for one line: \"Sometimes we lie to survive. Does that make it right, or just understandable?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The house is trying to make Averic confront his secret, but not cruelly\u2014it's asking questions, not condemning. The magic feels almost... therapeutic?</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Hidden among the false books: one real book, \"The Ethics of Academic Truth\" by Professor Ondra Klees (Averic's supposed mentor). It's genuine. Averic's mentor really wrote this. Inside, an inscription: \"To future scholars: Truth is a gift we give each other. Guard it carefully. \u2014O.K.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Forger's Confession.</strong> Opens to a page describing, in excruciating detail, how to forge academic documents. If Averic reads it, he must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or be shaken (disadvantage on the next check or save).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The \"confession\" describes forging letters from a mentor who died before verifying their authenticity. Every detail matches Averic's own forgery.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Margin notes in handwriting that looks like Averic's (but isn't): \"I thought I was the only one. I thought I was uniquely terrible. I'm not. Does that make it better or worse?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under the pillow: a <strong>quill that never lies</strong>. Any document written with this quill cannot contain falsehoods (the ink refuses to form lying words). Potentially useful, but also dangerous for someone with secrets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Attached note: \"I tried to write my confession with this. The quill broke.

The medals are for campaigns in Quadling Country. A DC 12 History check identifies specific battles\u2014some of which were later revealed to be civilian massacres.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The uniform is perfectly maintained\u2014pressed, buttons polished, rank insignia aligned.

The citation reads \"decisive action in pacifying hostile territory.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> The uniform is both accusation and penance. Whoever wears this (or wore it) can't forget what it represents. The military honor and the atrocity are inseparable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Children's Drawings.</strong> From the village. Trophies, or guilt objects? A DC 14 Insight check suggests the latter\u2014these weren't taken in triumph. They were taken to remember. To not forget what was done.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Each drawing is labeled in adult handwriting: \"Tima, age 4,\" \"Kellin, age 7,\" \"Joss, age 5.\" Names paired with ages. Someone wanted to remember them as individuals.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One drawing shows soldiers and villagers together, smiling. Before. Another shows fire. After. They were drawn by the same child, days apart.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> These drawings weren't trophies. They were saved as evidence, as witness, as refusal to let the dead be forgotten or reduced to \"collateral damage.\" Someone\u2014maybe Mareth, maybe Yackle\u2014insisted they be remembered as real children who drew pictures and had names.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> In the uniform pocket: a <strong>letter of commendation</strong> for \"decisive action in clearing hostile territory.\" It's signed by a general whose name was later disgraced for war crimes.

Guest Room 3 \u2014 The Animal's Room</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA simple room, but the mirror on the wall is wrong. It doesn't show your reflection\u2014it shows something else. Something with a pointed snout. Something with fur. The bed has claw marks on the posts, and the window is barred from the inside, as if someone wanted to make sure they couldn't get out.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Mirror.</strong> Shows Frederick's true form, regardless of who looks into it. If Frederick looks, he sees himself as the Fox he is. If someone else looks, they see a fox standing where Frederick should be. The effect lasts only for this room.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The mirror shows <em>truth</em>, not appearance. It cuts through illusions, glamours, disguises\u2014revealing what IS beneath what SEEMS.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the mirror's frame: \"To see yourself truly is to risk being seen by others. Worth it? Sometimes. Not always. Never safely.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> If Frederick sees this before his secret is revealed to the party, he faces a terrible choice: acknowledge what he sees (truth) or deny it (survival). The room is asking: how long can you pretend?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Claw Marks.</strong> On the bed posts and the windowsill. Made by an Animal in distress. How long ago? Impossible to tell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The claw marks spell words: \"PLEASE\" on one post, \"SEE ME\" on another, \"I'M REAL\" on the windowsill.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Fur caught in the wood grain\u2014red-gold, like fox fur. Old, but preserved by the house's magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 16:</strong> The marks were made frantically, compulsively, over hours or days. Someone was trapped here, desperate to prove their existence, their consciousness, their personhood.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Bars.</strong> On the inside of the window. Someone locked themselves IN, not out. Under the window, scratched into the wood: <em>\"They'll find me. They always find us.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The bars aren't to prevent escape\u2014they're to prevent being seen. Someone hid here, voluntarily imprisoned, because being caged was safer than being discovered.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> The bars can be removed from inside. They were never truly locked. Someone could have left anytime but chose to stay hidden. Safety over freedom.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under a loose floorboard (Investigation DC 15): <strong>forged papers</strong> for someone named \"Brush Tanner\"\u2014clearly Animal papers, creating a false human identity. The forgery is masterful. The papers include a note: <em>\"The underground never forgets its friends. \u2014B.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The papers are blank templates\u2014ready to be filled in with any name, any history. A kit for creating new identities. How many Animals have used these?</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Dates on the templates span decades. The Underground has been operating for a long time, helping Animals hide in plain sight. Frederick isn't alone. He's part of a network.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Bed.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The pillow has been clawed open, stuffing pulled out and rearranged into a nest. Animal instinct overriding human pretense.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Hidden in the nest: a child's primer on \"How to Be Human\" \u2014 lessons on walking upright, using utensils, suppressing instincts. Heartbreaking in its specificity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>16. The Nursery</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA child's room, preserved in amber. Toys arranged on shelves. A rocking horse stands in one corner, frozen mid-rock. Picture books are stacked on a small table. A tiny bed with a canopy, and sitting on the bed, a doll that looks almost like a real child. No\u2014wait. The doll is looking at you. It blinked.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not a doll. This is the <strong>Ghost Child</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Ghost Child.</strong> Name is Holly. She's been dead for 300 years but doesn't entirely understand this. She appears to be about six years old, translucent, wearing a nightgown. She's lonely. She wants someone to play with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interacting with Holly:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>She speaks in a child's simple way but knows things she shouldn't</li>\n<li>She calls Yackle \"the lady who changes\" and says she's been here \"forever\"</li>\n<li>She doesn't understand she's dead\u2014she thinks she's waiting for her mother</li>\n<li>She cannot leave the nursery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What Holly Knows:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"The lady changes faces but she's always the same underneath\"</li>\n<li>\"The house loves her but she doesn't love it back\"</li>\n<li>\"Everyone leaves eventually. Usually down.\" (gestures toward the floor\u2014the cellar)</li>\n<li>\"There are words that hurt her. Old words. From before.\"</li>\n<li><strong>If asked about her mother:</strong> \"Mama was the cook. Mama made bread. The lady said Mama would come back. She didn't come back.\"</li>\n<li><strong>If asked why she's here:</strong> \"I was sick. The lady tried to help. She tried so hard. She cried and cried. I went to sleep and then I woke up like this.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>EARNING GUIDANCE OF THE HOUSE:</strong> If a player engages kindly with Holly\u2014plays with her, reads her a story, treats her like a person\u2014they earn:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guidance of the House:</strong> Bonus action: Grant a d4 to an ally's next ability check. Unlimited uses.</p>\n\n<p>Holly will occasionally whisper warnings to this character for the rest of the session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Toys.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> All the toys are handmade\u2014carved wood, sewn cloth, nothing store-bought. Someone made these with care.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> One doll looks like a woman with green-tinted skin. Holly calls it \"Miss Yael.\" The doll's face has been repaired many times\u2014loved to pieces.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> These aren't just Holly's toys. They're her world\u2014the only thing she has. She's been playing with them for 300 years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Picture Books.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Stories about friendship, adventure, mothers coming home. Bookmarked at specific pages\u2014read over and over.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One book has extra pages added\u2014drawings of Holly and \"the lady\" doing things together: baking, gardening, reading. Captions: \"We had tea,\" \"She taught me letters,\" \"She said sorry again.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Someone\u2014Yackle\u2014has been visiting Holly, playing with her, trying to give her companionship. But Holly doesn't understand she's dead, and Yackle can't bear to tell her.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Rocking Horse.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Carved into the base: \"For Holly, age 6. May you ride to bright places. \u2014Mira\" (her mother, the cook)</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The horse rocks on its own sometimes, gently. Holly's ghost playing even when no one's here.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> View of the cemetery. One small grave, child-sized, with flowers. Holly doesn't look that direction. She never looks there.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>17. Yackle's Study</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThis room is different. The dust is disturbed. Someone has been here recently. A desk is covered in star charts, astronomical calculations, and pages of dense text in a language that shifts when you try to read it. Bookshelves hold journals and ledgers. A telescope points out the window at the sky. And on one shelf, in a place of honor, sits an ornate puzzle box covered in strange symbols.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Star Charts.</strong> Depict constellations that don't exist in Oz's sky. A DC 16 Arcana check identifies them as depicting the Kumbric Void\u2014what existed before Lurline made the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The charts aren't observations\u2014they're memories. Someone is trying to map a place that doesn't exist anymore, drawing from recollection of before creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> Annotations in the margins: \"Chaos doesn't have geography, you fool. How can you miss a place that never had form?\" Someone arguing with themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One constellation is circled repeatedly: eight stars arranged in a binding pattern. Each star is labeled with a Word: Remember, Connect, Become, Serve, Give, Transform, Hunger, Witness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Shifting Text.</strong> Grimmerie pages, fragments only. Attempting to read them requires a DC 18 Intelligence check; failure results in 1d4 psychic damage and the unsettling feeling that the pages read YOU.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16 (if check succeeds):</strong> The pages describe the original Binding\u2014Lurline speaking Eight Words to give reality structure. But the tone isn't celebratory. It's mournful: \"She spoke Order into Chaos. She didn't ask if Chaos wanted to be ordered.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 19:</strong> These pages are trying to reverse-engineer the Bindings, to find a way to unmake them. Every attempt has failed, crossed out in frustrated handwriting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Journals.</strong> More of Yackle's journals. These are more recent\u2014the last 50 years or so. They describe her preparations, her searches for the right \"heirs,\" her growing desperation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Recent Journal Entry.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"Year 954. I have found them. Finally, after so long.\n<br><br>\nThe scholar who fabricates. The soldier who claims false blood. The fox who wears human skin. The maunt whose service was punished. The Arjiki who traded instead of gave. The soldier whose deed did not transform him. The machine that hungers.\n<br><br>\nSeven inversions. Seven keys.\n<br><br>\nI will wear the face of a widow. I will walk among them. I will make them trust me.\n<br><br>\nAnd when they have given me their truths, freely spoken\u2014I will finally, finally stop.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Earlier journals describe failed attempts: \"Year 903 group dissolved into infighting. Too much fear. Not enough trust.\" \"Year 847 group all fled after the second twist. Cowards? No. Smart. Smarter than I gave them credit for.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Recent entries, last few days: \"They're here. I'm terrified. I'm hopeful. If this works, I end. If this fails, I continue. I don't know which outcome I fear more.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> Reading chronologically: centuries of loneliness, desperation, planning. Then fear, guilt, hesitation. Yackle knows what she's doing is monstrous. She's doing it anyway because she's so tired.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Puzzle Box.</strong> The ILOVEU puzzle box. Ornate, covered in symbols. The symbols are the eight binding words (see Chapel windows). To open it, enter the code on the physical puzzle box prop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inside the Puzzle Box:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>map</strong> showing the location of the Heart Chamber (behind the cellar wall)</li>\n<li>A <strong>portrait miniature</strong> of Yackle's true face\u2014young, hopeful, green-tinged</li>\n<li>A <strong>note</strong>: <em>\"If you found this, you looked. That's more than anyone has done in a thousand years.\"</em></li>\n<li><strong>Lurline's Word</strong>\u2014a shard of green crystal inscribed with the word \"REMEMBER\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>EARNING LURLINE'S WORD:</strong> Once during battle, speak the Word to deal 4d10 radiant damage to Yackle (no save).</p>\n\n<p><strong>EARNING FLASH OF GENIUS:</strong> The player who figures out the puzzle box code gains:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flash of Genius:</strong> Reaction: Add +5 to any ability check or saving throw within 30 ft. 3 uses total.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (examining the box):</strong> Each symbol corresponds to a letter. The symbols are from the Chapel windows\u2014each Binding has a visual representation that encodes a letter.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tiny scratches around the lock mechanism. Someone has tried to open this by force, failed, given up.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Desk.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Hidden drawer (DC to find) contains: a bracelet (child-sized, \"Holly\" engraved), a letter from \"Willem\" accepting the butler position, a dried flower from the greenhouse. Keepsakes. Memories of people who mattered.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Carved into the underside of the desk: \"I cannot remember what warmth felt like before loneliness. Does that mean I was never truly warm?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>18. The Observatory</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe ceiling is domed glass, offering an unobstructed view of the night sky. But the stars aren't right. They're too bright, too close, and they're moving in patterns that make your head hurt if you watch too long. A massive telescope dominates the room, pointed at something specific. An orrery\u2014a mechanical model of celestial bodies\u2014sits on a pedestal, but its planets are unfamiliar shapes. An hourglass on a shelf shows sand falling, but you can't tell how much remains.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Telescope.</strong> Points at the Kumbric Void\u2014the space between stars where reality isn't quite real. Looking through it requires a DC 14 Wisdom save. On failure: 1d6 psychic damage and the character is shaken. On success: The character sees shapes moving in the void\u2014things that existed before Oz. One of them turns and looks back.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The telescope isn't magnifying distant objects\u2014it's punching through the Bindings temporarily, showing what reality looked like before Lurline imposed order. It's seeing into pre-creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Etched into the telescope barrel: \"I came from there. Sometimes I still hear it calling. Chaos was lonely, but at least loneliness was all there was. Now I know what I'm missing.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> Looking through the telescope is nostalgia for someone like Yackle\u2014homesickness for the Void, the pre-binding state where she wasn't trapped by the need to be witnessed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Orrery.</strong> Shows celestial bodies that shouldn't exist. Eight planets (not Oz's actual astronomy), each inscribed with one of the binding words. A DC 15 Arcana check can identify this as a model of Lurline's original cosmological ordering\u2014the conceptual structure underlying reality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The planets move in perfect synchronization\u2014when one orbits, all orbit together. They're bound to each other. Breaking one orbit would destabilize the entire system.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One planet (Witness) has a crack running through it. Recent. The crack appeared when the first player stepped into the estate.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The orrery isn't a model\u2014it's a real-time display of the Bindings' status. As the players break seals and weaken Bindings, the corresponding planets develop cracks, orbits wobble.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hourglass.</strong> Shows how long until dawn\u2014and the end of the adventure. If the DM wants to make time pressure visible, use this. The sand falls faster when the players are idle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The hourglass can't be turned over. Once the sand runs out, it's done. No second chances.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The sand isn't sand\u2014it's crystallized time, each grain a moment of existence. Watching closely, you can see memories in the grains: faces, places, moments.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 19:</strong> If all the sand runs out before the party defeats Yackle, the Bindings collapse entirely. Reality unravels. Everyone dies\u2014not just here, but across all of Oz. The stakes are literally everything.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The stars visible through the dome spell out words in constellation patterns: \"BEFORE SHE SPOKE\" and \"AFTER SHE SPOKE\" and \"I REMEMBER BOTH.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> Painted around the dome's edge, tiny script: coordinates. Not spatial coordinates\u2014temporal. Dates spanning from \"Before Time\" to \"954 OZ.\" A thousand-year timeline of existence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>19. The Hall of Mirrors (SEAL 6: DEED)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nMirrors line both walls of this long corridor, dozens of them in ornate frames. But they don't reflect what's in front of them\u2014or rather, they don't reflect it correctly. One mirror shows you younger. Another shows you older. One shows you in different clothes. One shows nothing at all, just empty glass. And as you walk down the hall, you begin to see things in the mirrors that haven't happened yet. Or things that have happened and you'd rather forget.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Mirrors.</strong> Each shows a different version of the character looking into it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One shows the character at their happiest</li>\n<li>One shows them at their most ashamed</li>\n<li>One shows what they might become</li>\n<li>One shows what they're afraid of becoming</li>\n<li>One shows their death (shadowy, unclear, disturbing)</li>\n<li>One shows nothing (the character has no reflection\u2014deeply unsettling)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each mirror is labeled with a small brass plaque: \"Joy,\" \"Shame,\" \"Potential,\" \"Fear,\" \"End,\" \"Void.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The \"Void\" mirror (showing no reflection) has handprints on the glass\u2014dozens of them, layered over centuries. People touching the glass where their reflection should be.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The mirrors aren't random\u2014they're a progression. The hall is designed to make you confront your past, present, and future. To see all versions of yourself simultaneously.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The mirrors are linked. What you see in one affects what you see in the others. If you acknowledge your shame, your potential becomes clearer. If you deny your past, your future becomes darker.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The True Mirror.</strong> At the end of the hall, larger than the others. This mirror shows what the character has DONE. Not what they look like, not what they might be\u2014what they've actually done in their life. The images are not kind.</p>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF DEED PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each character who walks through sees their actions reflected</li>\n<li>To complete the seal, ONE character must stand before the True Mirror and say, aloud: <em>\"That is me. I did that.\"</em></li>\n<li>Acknowledging their deeds\u2014not excusing them, not explaining them, but accepting them</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is hardest for Mareth, who must acknowledge the massacre. But any character can complete the seal by acknowledging their own actions.</p>\n\n<p>When the seal breaks, all the mirrors shatter simultaneously. In the silence, a whispered voice: <em>\"Finally. Someone took responsibility.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Resolve Token</strong> (reroll one failed saving throw, once).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specific Reflections:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mareth sees:</strong> Red Clay Fork burning. Faces of children. Orders being given. Fire spreading. The medal ceremony afterward. His unchanged face in the mirror after everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Averic sees:</strong> Hunched over a desk, forging letters. Practicing a dead man's handwriting. Accepting accolades. Building a career on lies. Students trusting him to teach them about truth.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick sees:</strong> Putting on the ring of disguise for the first time. Practicing human mannerisms. Lying to everyone, every day. The exhaustion of performance. The fear of being seen.</li>\n<li><strong>Shell sees:</strong> Finding the documents. Going to the Mother Superior. Being cast out. Standing outside the mauntery gates, alone. Still praying despite everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Sarima sees:</strong> The night her brother almost died. Reaching out to the void. Feeling something take hold. Making the deal. The weight settling into her chest. Every spell she's cast since, knowing it's not hers.</li>\n<li><strong>Seven sees:</strong> Winding themselves. Feeling things they shouldn't feel. Hiding their emotions. Asking \"why am I lonely?\" and being told \"you're not programmed for loneliness.\" Not believing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Liir sees:</strong> Finding the genealogy records. Discovering the truth (no Ostrega blood). Deciding to lie anyway. Using the false name. Getting respect he didn't earn. Being terrified of being nobody.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Frames.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the frames, barely visible: \"Year 402. I looked in every mirror. I saw nothing. Am I so used to masks I have no face left?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>The Cellar</h2>\n\n<h3>20. The Wine Cellar</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe stairs descend into darkness, the temperature dropping as you go. The wine cellar is vast\u2014rows of barrels and racks of bottles extending into the shadows. The smell is wrong, though. Not wine. Something sharper. Something organic. The labels on the barrels aren't years or vintages. They're names.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Barrels.</strong> Labeled with names, not dates. A DC 12 Investigation check confirms these are names from the Memorial Room\u2014previous heirs. The barrels do not contain wine. A DC 14 Constitution save to avoid retching when this is realized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each barrel has a date: \"E. Strand, 347,\" \"M. Vett, 614,\" \"V. Tallis, 903.\" The years they died. The barrels are coffins or worse.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> Faint necromantic magic emanates from the barrels. Not animation\u2014preservation. The bodies aren't decomposing. They're being kept.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> This isn't a trophy room. It's a mausoleum. Someone couldn't bear to let go, couldn't bear to bury people who were, perhaps, the closest thing to companionship they had. Horrifying, but also desperately sad.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One barrel, separate from the others, larger: \"For the Eighth.\" Empty. Waiting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Wine Racks.</strong> Some actual wine bottles here, perfectly preserved. One bottle, older than the others, is labeled \"For the End.\" It contains a single dose of <strong>potion of invulnerability</strong> (resistance to all damage for 1 hour). Was Yackle saving this for someone? Herself?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Other bottles have labels: \"For Willem's 50th,\" \"For Mira's Wedding,\" \"For the Day Someone Stays.\" Events that never happened, wine saved for celebrations that never came.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One bottle is open, empty, placed carefully on its side. Label: \"For Hope.\" Someone drank it. It didn't help.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hidden Door.</strong> Behind a rack of barrels (Investigation DC 18 without the map, automatic with the map from the puzzle box): a false wall that leads to the Heart Chamber.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The door mechanism is old but well-maintained. Used regularly. Someone goes down there often.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Scratch marks on the floor in front of the door\u2014heel marks, drag marks. Someone was pulled through this door, struggling. Or someone dragged themselves through, desperate to reach what lies beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h3>21. The Main Cellar</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nBeyond the wine cellar, the space opens into a larger chamber with stone walls older than the house above. Old furniture is piled here, draped in canvas\u2014chairs, tables, a broken bed frame. Crates of books and papers are stacked against the walls. The air is thick and tastes of copper. Against the far wall, hidden behind furniture, the stones are slightly different\u2014newer, or perhaps just disturbed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Furniture.</strong> From different eras, accumulated over centuries. A DC 14 Investigation check finds personal items from previous heirs tucked into the furniture: a locket, a journal, a military badge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each piece of furniture has a tag: \"Guest 47's favorite chair,\" \"Visitor 103 slept here,\" \"Heir 125 wrote poetry at this desk.\" Someone catalogued everything, preserved everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One chair, covered in canvas, has been sat in recently\u2014the canvas is displaced. Someone comes down here, sits in a dead person's chair, and does... what? Remembers? Mourns?</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't storage\u2014it's a museum of the dead. Every object preserved because letting go would mean admitting they're gone, admitting that all the companionship was temporary, that loneliness won again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Previous Heir's Journal.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"Day 3 in the house.

The walls are stone, but they move\u2014slowly, rhythmically, like breathing. In the center of the room, suspended by threads of shadow that connect to three points on the walls, is a figure. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. This is Yackle's original body\u2014what she was before a thousand years of masks and lies.\n<br><br>\nThe threads of shadow pulse with each breath of the walls. This is the heart of the house. This is what you've been searching for.\n<br><br>\nThis is where it ends.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Body.</strong> Yackle's original form, sustained by magic for over a thousand years. Not dead, not alive\u2014suspended. When Yackle reveals herself and the battle begins, this is where Phase 3 occurs. Her consciousness returns here when the house-form is driven out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Medicine DC 15:</strong> The body is impossibly old but perfectly preserved. No decay, but no life either. Frozen at the moment between existence and non-existence.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The preservation isn't a spell\u2014it's the Binding of Witness itself. As long as Yackle remains unseen (her true self), she cannot fully live or die. Existence locked in stasis.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Looking at the body, you feel overwhelming sadness. This isn't power or triumph. It's a prison. Someone trapped here for a millennium, unable to die, unable to live, unable to be seen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Anchor Points.</strong> Three glowing nodes where shadow-threads connect to the walls. To truly defeat Yackle, these must be destroyed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AC:</strong> 12</li>\n<li><strong>HP:</strong> 30 each</li>\n<li><strong>Immune to:</strong> Necrotic, psychic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Destroying an anchor deals 20 damage to Yackle and permanently reduces her legendary actions by 1. She can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each anchor point is inscribed with a word: \"PAST,\" \"PRESENT,\" \"FUTURE.\" Destroying them severs Yackle's connection to time itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The anchors aren't just sustaining her body\u2014they're binding her to the house, to the estate, to this specific location. She literally cannot leave.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Walls.</strong> Breathing. Watching. The house itself, concentrated here. During Phase 3, lair actions originate from these walls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The walls are covered in writing\u2014tiny, cramped, layered over centuries. Names, dates, conversations, confessions. The walls have absorbed a thousand years of loneliness.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Reading the walls (takes time): \"Year 350. I hate you, Lurline. Year 500. I miss the void. Year 680. Willem died today. Year 783. Little Holly doesn't understand. Year 900. Please, someone. Year 954. They're coming. Finally.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Eighth Seal.</strong> This chamber IS the eighth seal\u2014the Seal of Witness. When Yackle is finally seen (truly seen, in her real form, in her real place), the eighth binding breaks. This happens automatically when the players reach this room during the final battle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The moment the party sees Yackle's true body, reality shudders. The eighth Binding\u2014Witness\u2014cracks. To exist is to be seen, and Yackle has been hiding for a millennium. Being seen now doesn't free her\u2014it breaks her.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Yackle wanted this. She wanted to be seen, to break the final Binding, to achieve the dissolution she's craved for centuries. The players finding this chamber is victory for her, even if they defeat her afterward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Floor.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Carved into the stone: a perfect eight-pointed star, each point labeled with a Binding. The body hangs at the center\u2014the intersection of all eight principles, the knot that holds reality together.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> In the exact center, beneath the body, one word carved deeper than all others: \"LOVE.\" Or is it \"LOSS\"? The letters blur together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>GM Notes on the Estate</h2>\n\n<h3>Using the Rooms</h3>\n\n<p>Players will likely explore 12-15 rooms before the reveal. Guide them toward seal rooms early, but reward exploration of others with lore, items, and character moments.</p>\n\n<h3>The House's Personality</h3>\n\n<p>The estate is an extension of Yackle\u2014simultaneously welcoming and trapping, desperate for companionship yet designed to consume. It provides comfort (food, warmth, information) but never freedom.</p>\n\n<h3>Discovery Rewards</h3>\n\n<p>Characters who thoroughly investigate earn special abilities beyond the seals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guidance of the House</strong> (Holly, Nursery)</li>\n<li><strong>Inspiration of the Fallen</strong> (Memorial Room)</li>\n<li><strong>Flash of Genius</strong> (Puzzle Box)</li>\n<li><strong>Lurline's Word</strong> (Puzzle Box)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Pacing</h3>\n\n<p>Use the Observatory's hourglass to create visible time pressure. Speed up exploration if players are being too cautious; slow down if they're rushing and missing important details.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/the-seven-seals', 'The Seven Seals'); return false;\">The Seven Seals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle NPC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('creatures/house-horrors', 'House Horrors'); return false;\">House Horrors</a></li>\n</ul>",

Each letter states that the recipient has been named in the will of <strong>Yackle Ostreaga</strong>, a legendary witch who died (supposedly) a century ago. The letters provide travel arrangements to a remote estate in the Pertha Hills of Gillikin, where the will shall be read and the inheritance distributed.</p>\n\n<p>Each player arrives with their own reason for being there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A scholar seeking forbidden knowledge</li>\n<li>A soldier claiming blood relation</li>\n<li>A disguised Animal fleeing persecution</li>\n<li>An ex-maunt seeking redemption</li>\n<li>An Arjiki woman with bargained magic</li>\n<li>A guilt-haunted military captain</li>\n<li>A mechanical being questioning its existence</li>\n<li>A widow (secretly Yackle herself)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upon arrival, solicitor <strong>Mr. Trism</strong> reads the will: To claim the inheritance, the heirs must unlock <strong>seven seals</strong> hidden throughout the estate before dawn. The one who proves most worthy shall receive the greatest share.</p>\n\n<h3>What the Players Don't Know</h3>\n\n<p>This is not a competition\u2014it's a ritual. Each player embodies an <strong>inversion</strong> of one of <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">Lurline's Eight Bindings</a>, the cosmic principles that give Oz its structure. Yackle needs their freely-given secrets to break these Bindings and achieve either dissolution (peace) or ascension (godhood).</p>\n\n<p>And one of them\u2014disguised as \"Madame Viridian\"\u2014is Yackle herself.</p>\n\n<h2>The Core Twist</h2>\n\n<p>This adventure has <strong>two major twists</strong>:</p>\n\n<h3>The First Twist (End of Hour 1)</h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> The grandfather clock in the Foyer chimes thirteen times at midnight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Reveal:</strong> The inheritance isn't for one person\u2014it's for <em>all survivors</em>. And the amount each receives <em>increases</em> with the number who survive. The competition was a lie. The house, now fully awakened, will try to kill them. They must work together to survive until dawn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The players realize cooperation is survival. The house becomes actively hostile. Upper floors unlock. Lair actions begin.</p>\n\n<h3>The Second Twist (End of Hour 3)</h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> The seventh seal (Hunger) is completed in the Dining Room.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Reveal:</strong> Madame Viridian drops her disguise. She is <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a>, and she's been among them the whole time, collecting their secrets. The seals weren't tests of worthiness\u2014they were keys to breaking the Bindings. The final battle begins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Betrayal, shock, and the transition from exploration to combat. Phase 1 of Yackle's boss fight begins.</p>\n\n<h2>Session Timeline</h2>\n\n<p>The adventure is structured into four distinct hours, each with specific goals, available content, and dramatic beats.</p>\n\n<h3>Hour 1: Arrival & Investigation (60 minutes)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish atmosphere, introduce characters, complete 2-3 seals, build mystery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0:00-0:15 \u2014</strong> Players arrive individually at the estate. Brief introductions. Atmospheric descriptions of the grounds and cemetery.</li>\n<li><strong>0:15-0:25 \u2014</strong> Will reading in the Foyer. Mr. Trism explains the rules: seven seals, before dawn, prove your worth. He departs mysteriously.</li>\n<li><strong>0:25-0:55 \u2014</strong> Ground floor exploration. Players investigate rooms, discover lore, and attempt seals.</li>\n<li><strong>0:55-1:00 \u2014</strong> <strong>THE FIRST TWIST:</strong> Clock chimes thirteen times. Mr. Trism reappears (or his corpse is found). The truth is revealed: survive together or die separately. The house awakens.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Available Locations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Approach & Cemetery (Grounds)</li>\n<li>The Foyer (entry point)</li>\n<li>The Parlor</li>\n<li>The Music Room (SEAL 1: MEMORY)</li>\n<li>The Library (SEAL 3: NATURE)</li>\n<li>The Chapel (SEAL 5: SACRIFICE)</li>\n<li>The Kitchen</li>\n<li>The Greenhouse</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Seals Available:</strong> Memory, Nature, Sacrifice</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pacing Notes:</strong> Keep exploration brisk. Encourage players to split up initially (more suspicious, more discovery). Guide them toward at least 2 seals before the clock chimes. Foreshadow Yackle/Viridian's tells subtly.</p>\n\n<h3>Hour 2: Escalation & Cooperation (60 minutes)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> First combat, team bonding, complete 3-4 more seals, deepen mystery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1:00-1:15 \u2014</strong> Immediate aftermath of the First Twist. House becomes hostile. First lair action or combat encounter (animated furniture, memory shades, or house horror).</li>\n<li><strong>1:15-1:30 \u2014</strong> Players regroup, discuss strategy, share information. Yackle/Viridian positions herself as helpful ally, asking probing questions.</li>\n<li><strong>1:30-1:55 \u2014</strong> Upper floors now accessible. Continued exploration, seal completion, lore discovery. Puzzle box potentially found in Study.</li>\n<li><strong>1:55-2:00 \u2014</strong> Transition moment: players likely heading toward Dining Room for final seal, or discovering the cellar entrance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Available Locations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All ground floor rooms</li>\n<li>The Dining Room (SEAL 7: HUNGER)</li>\n<li>The Servant Quarters (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 1)</li>\n<li>Portrait Gallery (SEAL 2: BLOOD) - Upper floor</li>\n<li>Memorial Room (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 2) - Upper floor</li>\n<li>Master Bedroom - Upper floor</li>\n<li>Guest Rooms 1-3 (character-specific nightmare rooms) - Upper floor</li>\n<li>The Nursery (Holly the ghost child) - Upper floor</li>\n<li>Yackle's Study (puzzle box) - Upper floor</li>\n<li>The Observatory - Upper floor</li>\n<li>Hall of Mirrors (SEAL 6: DEED) - Upper floor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Seals Available:</strong> Blood, Service (both parts), Deed, Hunger</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pacing Notes:</strong> First combat should be challenging but winnable\u2014establish stakes. Reward thorough exploration (special abilities from Holly, puzzle box, etc.). Build tension around secrets\u2014Yackle should be present for at least 3-4 secret reveals by this point.</p>\n\n<h3>Hour 3: The Unraveling (45 minutes)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Complete final seal, trigger the reveal, begin boss fight Phase 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2:00-2:15 \u2014</strong> Final seal preparation. Likely in the Dining Room (Seal of Hunger). Players must openly acknowledge their wants/hungers.</li>\n<li><strong>2:15-2:20 \u2014</strong> <strong>THE SECOND TWIST:</strong> Seventh seal breaks. Yackle reveals herself. \"How wonderful. You've made this so much easier.\" Madame Viridian's disguise drops. She manifests as herself.</li>\n<li><strong>2:20-2:45 \u2014</strong> <strong>PHASE 1 BATTLE:</strong> Yackle fights at full power (200 HP, or 100 HP if all seals completed). Uses collected secrets against the party. Tactical spellcasting, legendary actions, memory drain. Location: initially Dining Room, may move through upper floors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Combat Location:</strong> Starts in Dining Room, can move throughout the house as Yackle uses <em>dimension door</em> and mobility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1 Objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce Yackle to 100 HP or lower</li>\n<li>Survive her Kumbric Extraction attempts</li>\n<li>Deal with collected secret penalties</li>\n<li>Trigger Phase 2 transition</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pacing Notes:</strong> The reveal should be a genuine shock\u2014even if players suspected Viridian, the confirmation is dramatic. Give the Yackle player a moment to roleplay the transformation. Phase 1 combat should be intense\u2014use legendary actions, lair actions, and secret-based abilities liberally. When Yackle reaches 100 HP, she merges with the house.</p>\n\n<h3>Hour 4: The Reckoning (45-55 minutes)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Chase through house to Heart Chamber, Phases 2-3 battle, resolution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2:45-3:00 \u2014</strong> <strong>PHASE 2: THE CHASE.</strong> Yackle merges with the house, becomes omnipresent. Players must find and reach the Heart Chamber in the cellar. Lair actions intensify. Shifting geometry, animated threats, Yackle attacking from walls/floors/ceilings.</li>\n<li><strong>3:00-3:30 \u2014</strong> <strong>PHASE 3: THE HEART CHAMBER.</strong> Players reach the cellar, find the false wall (with or without map from puzzle box), enter Heart Chamber. They witness Yackle's true form suspended in the center. The Eighth Binding (Witness) cracks. Final battle begins. Destroy anchors, defeat Yackle in her true form.</li>\n<li><strong>3:30-3:45 \u2014</strong> <strong>RESOLUTION.</strong> Yackle is defeated through violence, mercy, or binding. The house's fate is determined. Epilogue: what happens to each character after they leave (or stay).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Combat Locations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phase 2: Throughout the house (chase sequence)</li>\n<li>Wine Cellar (transition)</li>\n<li>Main Cellar (approach)</li>\n<li>Heart Chamber (Phase 3 finale)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Survive the house's lair actions</li>\n<li>Find the Heart Chamber (map helps significantly)</li>\n<li>Reach the cellar without being separated</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3 Objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Destroy the three anchor points (PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE)</li>\n<li>Reduce Yackle to 0 HP, or</li>\n<li>Negotiate peaceful dissolution, or</li>\n<li>Volunteer to re-bind her as warden</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Optional Phase 4:</strong> If all 8 secrets were collected, Yackle transforms into Ascendant form (CR 15, near-TPK scenario). This should be rare and represents the worst-case outcome.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pacing Notes:</strong> Phase 2 should feel desperate and claustrophobic. Use lair actions every round. Phase 3 is the emotional climax\u2014let Yackle be vulnerable, sympathetic, and tragic even as she fights to survive. The resolution should feel earned, whether through violence or mercy.</p>\n\n<h2>Key NPCs</h2>\n\n<h3>Yackle (The Hidden Antagonist)</h3>\n<p><strong>Disguise:</strong> Madame Viridian, a widow seeking restitution for her husband's death</p>\n<p><strong>Truth:</strong> A fragment of pre-creation chaos, trapped by the Binding of Witness for over a millennium</p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Collect the eight inversions (player secrets) to break the Bindings and achieve dissolution or ascension</p>\n<p><strong>Stat Block:</strong> <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle (Full Stats)</a></p>\n\n<h3>Mr. Trism (The Solicitor)</h3>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> Reads the will, explains the rules, then disappears (or dies) when the First Twist occurs</p>\n<p><strong>Truth:</strong> Could be a construct created by the house, a previous heir's ghost, or a mundane lawyer who stumbles into danger. GM's choice based on tone preference.</p>\n\n<h3>Holly (The Ghost Child)</h3>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> The Nursery (upper floor)</p>\n<p><strong>Nature:</strong> Spirit of a 6-year-old girl who died 300 years ago.

Violence (Combat Victory)</h3>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Yackle is reduced to 0 HP in Phase 3 (or Phase 4). She crumbles to dust with final words: \"I only wanted... to see tomorrow.\" The house immediately begins collapsing. Players have 3 rounds to escape or take 10d10 bludgeoning damage per round buried in rubble.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> The estate is destroyed. Whatever inheritance existed is lost. But the players survive, each carrying a piece of Yackle's story. The Eighth Binding remains broken in this location\u2014strange things happen in the Pertha Hills now.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Mercy (Peaceful Dissolution)</h3>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> In Phase 3, players show Yackle genuine compassion and offer her a peaceful end. Requires DC 20 Persuasion or Insight check and sincere roleplaying. Yackle, finally witnessed and understood, chooses to let go. She fades peacefully, not into death but into gentle dissolution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> The house becomes mundane\u2014no longer sentient, but stable. It can be explored, and a genuine inheritance (books, artifacts, Yackle's accumulated wealth) can be claimed. The players leave changed, having given an ancient suffering being the gift of peace.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Re-Binding (Sacrificial Warden)</h3>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> A player volunteers to stay as the house's warden, binding Yackle but keeping her alive. The volunteer becomes the new keeper, living in the estate, maintaining the binding, and preventing Yackle's return to active malevolence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Bittersweet. The volunteer sacrifices freedom but gains purpose. The house remains sentient, Yackle remains trapped but alive. The other players leave with their shares of the inheritance. The warden can become an NPC for future campaigns\u2014a contact, quest-giver, or tragic figure.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Ascension (Phase 4 - TPK Risk)</h3>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> If all 8 secrets were collected, Yackle transforms into her Ascendant form (CR 15). The party faces a near-impossible battle. If they manage to win, Yackle shatters with a reality-breaking scream: \"I will return... I will always return...\" The house collapses violently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Even in victory, this ending is dark. Yackle's last words suggest she may reform eventually. The Bindings are fundamentally damaged. Reality in the area becomes unstable. Players escape but at great cost (possibly with casualties).</p>\n\n<h3>5. Failure (TPK)</h3>\n<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The party is defeated. Yackle consumes their secrets and life force. She achieves her goal and either dissolves (if she wanted oblivion) or ascends (if she wanted power).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> If running this as a campaign prelude, have the TPK be canon. The next campaign begins with a new party investigating why eight people vanished in the Pertha Hills. The house still stands. Something ancient waits inside.</p>\n\n<h2>Running the Adventure</h2>\n\n<h3>Pre-Session Preparation</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Essential Reading:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This adventure index (overview and timeline)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate</a> (all 22 rooms)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> (stat block and tactics)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/the-seven-seals', 'The Seven Seals'); return false;\">The Seven Seals</a> (puzzle mechanics)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> (cosmology)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>12 physical handouts (see Handouts section below)</li>\n<li>ILOVEU puzzle box (or representation)</li>\n<li>Music box prop (optional)</li>\n<li>Initiative tracker for 8 players + Yackle + lair actions</li>\n<li>Secret collection tracker (mark which secrets Yackle has collected)</li>\n<li>Estate map for reference (or hand-drawn version)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Player Briefing:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select one player to play Yackle (choose someone comfortable with secret antagonist roles)</li>\n<li>Provide that player with separate Yackle briefing document (roleplay guidance, tells to show, secret collection tracking)</li>\n<li>Provide all players with their character sheets, emphasizing their secrets</li>\n<li>Set expectations: gothic mystery, 4 hours, character secrets matter, cooperation required after Hour 1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Pacing Guidance</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Use a visible timer.</strong> Let players know how much real-time has elapsed. This creates natural urgency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hour 1: Leisurely.</strong> Let players explore, roleplay introductions, examine rooms thoroughly. Guide them toward 2-3 seals but don't rush.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hour 2: Moderate.</strong> First combat sets stakes. Keep exploration moving but reward thoroughness. 3-4 more seals completed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hour 3: Urgent.</strong> The reveal is dramatic\u2014give it space. Phase 1 combat is intense. Use legendary actions every round.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hour 4: Desperate.</strong> Time pressure is real. Phase 2 chase should feel claustrophobic. Phase 3 is cathartic. Resolution is earned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If running long:</strong> Condense Phase 2\u2014have players find the Heart Chamber more quickly. Simplify lair actions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If running short:</strong> Extend exploration in Hour 2. Add additional character-specific nightmare rooms or encounters.</p>\n\n<h3>Tracking Secrets</h3>\n\n<p>This is critical. Yackle (and you as GM) must track which secrets have been revealed in her presence:</p>\n\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 16px 0;\">\n<tr style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\">\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Character</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Secret</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Collected?</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Combat Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Averic</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Forged the letters from his mentor</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Disadvantage on Int saves; counter 1 spell free</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Liir</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">False Ostrega blood claim</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Advantage on attacks vs him; his damage -1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Frederick</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Actually an Animal (Fox)</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Dominate person once, no concentration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Shell</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Cast out for discovering maunt corruption</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Resistance to radiant; Shell's heals heal Yackle 25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Sarima</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Magic comes from void bargain, not heritage</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Use Sarima's spell slots; Sarima disadv. on concentration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Mareth</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Burned Red Clay Fork village, killed 143 children</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Disadvantage on attacks vs her; crits become normal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Seven</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Feels emotions despite being mechanical</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">\u2610</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px;\">Skip Seven's turn once; disadv. on Wis saves</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Mark each secret as collected when revealed in Yackle/Viridian's presence. Use these benefits in combat immediately.</p>\n\n<h2>Handouts</h2>\n\n<p>Physical handouts greatly enhance immersion. For detailed handout content, see the <strong>Handouts page</strong> (Task 6, to be created). Brief list:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Place Cards (Foyer):</strong> 8 cards with epithets describing each character's inversion</li>\n<li><strong>Gravestone Rubbing (Cemetery):</strong> Ostrega family crest and dates</li>\n<li><strong>The Ozma Gambit (Parlor):</strong> Note about the unfinished chess game</li>\n<li><strong>Sheet Music Fragments (Music Room):</strong> 4-5 pieces spelling \"REMEMBER\"</li>\n<li><strong>Journal Excerpts (Library):</strong> Three entries from years 347, 612, 901 OZ</li>\n<li><strong>Eight Windows Diagram (Chapel):</strong> Visual guide to the Eight Bindings</li>\n<li><strong>Recipe Card (Kitchen):</strong> \"For the Long Night\" cryptic recipe</li>\n<li><strong>Names of the Lost (Memorial Room):</strong> List of previous heirs</li>\n<li><strong>Unfinished Letter (Master Bedroom):</strong> \"I want U to know...\" with circled U</li>\n<li><strong>Family Tree (Portrait Gallery):</strong> Incomplete Ostrega genealogy</li>\n<li><strong>Recent Journal Entry (Study):</strong> Yackle's plan from year 954</li>\n<li><strong>Previous Heir's Journal (Cellar):</strong> Warning from someone who came before</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Common Pitfalls & Solutions</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Players suspect Viridian immediately and isolate/kill her before the reveal.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Yackle should play Viridian subtly\u2014warm, helpful, curious. Not suspicious. If players do isolate her, have her escape using <em>dimension door</em> or <em>misty step</em>, then trigger the reveal early (Hour 2 instead of Hour 3). Adjust accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Players don't reveal secrets voluntarily.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use Kumbric Extraction in combat to force revelations. Have room-specific encounters that pressure secrets (Guest Rooms, Hall of Mirrors). Yackle can also extract during Phase 1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Party splits up and gets picked off one by one.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> After the First Twist, emphasize survival through cooperation. Have early encounters punish solo exploration (animated objects, memory shades). Reward grouping up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Combat runs too long, session goes over 4 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use lair actions on initiative count 20 only (not 20 and 10). Reduce Phase 2 HP to 150 instead of 180. Simplify Phase 3 by removing one anchor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitfall:</strong> Players find the puzzle box immediately and get the map\u2014skip Phase 2 chase.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> This is fine! Reward smart play. Phase 2 can be shorter. Or add complication: the map is in code, requires translating symbols using Chapel windows.</p>\n\n<h2>Adapting for Fewer Players</h2>\n\n<p>This adventure is designed for 8 players but can be adapted:</p>\n\n<p><strong>6-7 Players:</strong> Simply use fewer character inversions. Yackle needs at least 5-6 to weaken the Bindings. Remove 1-2 characters (usually Liir and/or Mareth).</p>\n\n<p><strong>4-5 Players:</strong> Significant changes needed. Remove Yackle as player character\u2014she's purely NPC. Players are all legitimate heirs. Reduce Yackle's HP by 25%. Remove Phase 4 entirely. Focus on mystery and exploration over betrayal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2-3 Players:</strong> Not recommended. The player betrayal twist doesn't work with so few. Consider running this as a different adventure\u2014perhaps the players are investigators hired to find out what happened to eight missing heirs.</p>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate</a> - All 22 rooms with detailed descriptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle</a> - Complete stat blocks for all 4 phases</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/the-seven-seals', 'The Seven Seals'); return false;\">The Seven Seals</a> - Puzzle mechanics and rewards</li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings</a> - Cosmological lore</li>\n<li><strong>Handouts</strong> - 12 physical handouts (to be created)</li>\n<li><strong>GM Quick Reference</strong> - One-page cheat sheet (to be created)</li>\n<li><strong>Pregenerated Characters</strong> - 8 character sheets with secrets</li>\n</ul>",

Total Victory</h3>\n<p><strong>Condition:</strong> All 7 seals complete, defeat Yackle, most players survive<br>\n<strong>Outcome:</strong> House becomes neutral safe haven. Players inherit estate and Yackle's knowledge. Bindings remain intact.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Pyrrhic Victory</h3>\n<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Defeat Yackle but 4+ players dead, OR Yackle reaches Phase 4 but is stopped<br>\n<strong>Outcome:</strong> House collapses. Survivors escape barely. Estate destroyed but Oz is saved.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Mercy</h3>\n<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Players convince Yackle to accept oblivion (DC 20 Persuasion/Insight check)<br>\n<strong>Outcome:</strong> Yackle disperses peacefully. House fades. Players each receive a gift from her final act of sacrifice. Bittersweet.</p>\n\n<h3>4. The Unmaking (BAD END)</h3>\n<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Yackle collects all 8 secrets and isn't stopped in Phase 4<br>\n<strong>Outcome:</strong> The Eight Bindings begin to fray. Reality around the estate becomes unstable. Yackle achieves oblivion but takes a piece of Oz with her. The Pertha Hills become a \"blighted zone\" where the rules of reality don't fully apply. Survivors flee, traumatized.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Stalemate</h3>\n<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Players escape house before defeating Yackle, OR all players die<br>\n<strong>Outcome:</strong> Yackle remains trapped. In another century, she'll call new heirs. The cycle continues.</p>\n\n<h2>Common GM Pitfalls & Solutions</h2>\n\n<h3>Pitfall: Players suspect Viridian too early</h3>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Have Yackle/Viridian share a \"secret\" that's emotionally true (her loneliness, her exhaustion) even if the backstory is false. Make her sympathetic. Red herring another player with suspicious behavior.</p>\n\n<h3>Pitfall: Players refuse to share secrets</h3>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Yackle can use Memory Extraction (Wis save DC 16). Seals require vulnerability to complete. House horrors threaten them individually, forcing cooperation.</p>\n\n<h3>Pitfall: Combat takes too long</h3>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Phase 2 is a chase, not full combat. Phase 3 starts with anchors pre-damaged if time is short. Skip Phase 2 entirely if running behind.</p>\n\n<h3>Pitfall: Players get lost in 22 rooms</h3>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ghost child guides them. Seal locations glow faintly (Perception DC 12). Map handout shows rough layout.</p>\n\n<h3>Pitfall: Too many secrets revealed early</h3>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Yackle must be present (within 30 feet) to collect. She'll engineer situations to be nearby when secrets might emerge.</p>\n\n<h2>Pacing Guidelines</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If ahead of schedule:</strong> Add more atmospheric exploration, deeper NPC roleplay, extra house horror encounters</li>\n<li><strong>If behind schedule:</strong> Skip Phase 2 chase, start Phase 3 with anchors damaged, reduce HP pools by 25%</li>\n<li><strong>If party is struggling:</strong> Holly offers direct help, discovery abilities become easier to find, reduce DCs by 2</li>\n<li><strong>If party is dominating:</strong> Yackle collects secrets faster, adds more lair actions, uses environment creatively</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Pre-Session Prep Checklist</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\u2610 Print all 8 character sheets</li>\n<li>\u2610 Print handouts (place cards, journals, letters, puzzle box clues)</li>\n<li>\u2610 Prepare Yackle stat blocks (all phases)</li>\n<li>\u2610 Prepare house horror stat blocks (animated furniture, memory shades)</li>\n<li>\u2610 Brief Viridian player privately (30 min before session)</li>\n<li>\u2610 Sketch rough house map for players (or provide handout)</li>\n<li>\u2610 Prepare initiative tracker</li>\n<li>\u2610 Prepare secret tracking sheet</li>\n<li>\u2610 Prepare seal completion tracker</li>\n<li>\u2610 Set up atmospheric music/lighting</li>\n<li>\u2610 Review timeline and twist timings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\\'s Wake'); return false;\">The Witch's Wake \u2014 Full Adventure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\\'s Estate'); return false;\">Yackle's Estate \u2014 All 22 Rooms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;\">Yackle \u2014 Complete Stat Blocks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/the-seven-seals', 'The Seven Seals'); return false;\">The Seven Seals \u2014 Detailed Puzzles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;\">The Eight Bindings \u2014 Cosmology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"Tabs.openTab('character/pregen/the-scholar', 'Pregenerated Characters'); return false;\">The Eight Heirs \u2014 Character Sheets</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
