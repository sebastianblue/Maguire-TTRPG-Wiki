# FAILURE MECHANIC: THE HOUSE REMEMBERS

Each seal has a failure penalty that discourages guess-and-check. After **3 failures** on any seal, a more severe consequence occurs.

**Design Philosophy:** Wrong answers hurt. The house is testing worthiness, not patience. Players should think, investigate, and discuss before acting.

# SEAL 1: MEMORY
## The Music Room

### Read Aloud
> Dust motes drift through beams of pale moonlight falling on a grand piano, its lid propped open like a jaw. The keys are yellowed, some cracked. Sheet music is scattered across the music stand and the floor nearby — pages of half-finished compositions, annotations in cramped handwriting arguing with themselves. 
>
> Against one wall, a harp stands with three broken strings, the remaining strings humming faintly though no one touches them. A violin case lies open on a chair, the instrument inside missing its bow. Portraits of stern-faced musicians line the walls, their eyes following you.
>
> On a shelf beside the window sit **four music boxes** of different sizes and styles — one brass and ornate, one simple wood, one painted with flowers, one black lacquer. Each has a small crank on its side.
>
> Above the piano, a plaque reads: *"The original endures. Revisions are lies with prettier faces."*

### Key Features

**The Piano.** Playable but out of tune. The keys stick. A DC 12 Investigation check of the music stand finds one piece of sheet music with a note clipped to it: *"This is the one. Before I tried to improve it. Before I ruined everything. —O.K."*

**The Sheet Music.** The clipped piece shows a simple melody — four distinct phrases. The notation is rough, unpolished. Other scattered pages show the same melody but more elaborate, more "refined."

**The Music Boxes.** Four boxes, four melodies:
- **Brass Ornate:** Plays a complex, beautiful arrangement — the melody is there but buried under flourishes
- **Simple Wood:** Plays the original melody, plain and slightly awkward but true
- **Painted Flowers:** Plays a sweet, simplified version — recognizable but missing depth
- **Black Lacquer:** Plays the melody in a minor key — haunting, technically perfect, emotionally wrong

### The Puzzle

**Setup:** One music box matches the sheet music exactly. The others are "revisions" — changed, "improved," wrong.

**Solution:** 
1. Players wind and listen to each music box
2. Compare to the sheet music
3. Place the **Simple Wood** box on the piano's closed fallboard (the cover over the keys)
4. When the correct box plays on the piano, the room fills with the sound of distant applause, and the seal breaks

### The Trap for Averic

The **Brass Ornate** box sounds objectively *better* — fuller, more impressive. Averic's instinct (as a forger who "improves" things) will be to select this one. If he argues for it, Viridian can gently agree: *"Yes, surely the refined version is superior? Who wants to hear a rough draft?"*

### Viridian's Probing

*"Such a simple melody. Almost crude. Surely intent matters more than original notes? The composer clearly* meant *something grander..."* (Baiting Averic's instinct to value polish over truth)

### Failure Mechanic

**Wrong Box Placed:** The piano slams its lid shut with thunderous force. The player who placed it makes a **DC 13 Dexterity save** or takes **2d6 bludgeoning damage** (fingers caught). On success, 1d6 damage. The room fills with discordant shrieking for one round — all characters have **disadvantage on their next ability check**.

**After 3 Failures:** The piano plays the melody backward, once, slowly — a hint. Then the keys lock and won't respond for 10 minutes. The music boxes can still be played and compared, but they cannot be tested on the piano until the lockout ends.

### Reward
One character gains a **Reroll Token** (reroll one failed d20, once).

# SEAL 2: BLOOD
## The Portrait Gallery

### Read Aloud
> Family portraits line both walls of this long gallery, dozens of faces staring down at you. The Ostregas, according to the brass plaques beneath each frame — generations spanning centuries. Some portraits are formal: a patriarch in military dress, a matriarch in pearls. Others are almost candid: a child chasing a cat, a woman reading by firelight, a young man gazing out a window at something you cannot see.
>
> Eight portraits are larger than the others, spaced evenly along the hall, each with an **empty brass bracket** beneath the frame — the size and shape to hold a small piece of cloth.
>
> At the far end of the gallery, a glass-topped display case holds **eight squares of blue-and-white fabric**, each about four inches across, each with a different pattern. A card beside them reads: *"The Ostrega branches were known by their weave. Every child learned to recognize their cousins by cloth alone."*
>
> On the opposite wall, a faded tapestry shows the family tree — names and dates stretching back to the founding of the house.

### The Eight Textile Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Portrait Match |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Blue Dots on White** | Simple, honest, unpretentious | The Farmer — a man in work clothes, dirt under his nails, standing in a field |
| **Fish Scales** | Rippling, fluid, suggests water and trade | The Merchant — a woman at a dock, ships behind her, ledger in hand |
| **Tessellating Stars** | Mathematical, precise, endlessly repeating | The Scholar — an elderly man surrounded by books, astrolabe on desk |
| **Scrawled Language** | Chaotic, artistic, letters as texture | The Poet — a young woman with ink-stained fingers, papers scattered |
| **Diamonds with Circles** | Wealth displayed, gemlike pattern | The Banker — a stern man in fine clothes, vault door visible behind |
| **Dense Flowers** | Lush, cultivated, traditional beauty | The Matriarch — older woman in garden, pruning shears, rose in hair |
| **Pointillist Waves** | Impressionistic, suggests travel and distance | The Explorer — weathered figure with maps, foreign artifacts visible |
| **Sparse Small Flowers** | Delicate, scattered, rural simplicity | The Healer — gentle-faced woman, herbs drying behind her, mortar in hand |

### Portrait Details (For GM Reference)

**Portrait 1: The Farmer (Aldric Ostrega)**
- Wears simple homespun shirt
- Belt has a buckle with **dot pattern** barely visible
- Plaque: "Aldric Ostrega, Who Fed the Valley"

**Portrait 2: The Merchant (Ondine Ostrega)**  
- Silk shawl with visible **scale pattern** on the edges
- Plaque: "Ondine Ostrega, Who Opened the Rivers"

**Portrait 3: The Scholar (Erasmus Ostrega)**
- Collar has geometric **star pattern** embroidery
- Plaque: "Erasmus Ostrega, Who Counted the Heavens"

**Portrait 4: The Poet (Mira Ostrega)**
- Sleeve cuff shows **text/writing pattern** on trim
- Plaque: "Mira Ostrega, Whose Words Still Sing"

**Portrait 5: The Banker (Cassius Ostrega)**
- Cravat pin is **diamond-shaped with pearl center**
- Plaque: "Cassius Ostrega, Who Built the Vaults"

**Portrait 6: The Matriarch (Vera Ostrega)**
- Dress bodice has dense **floral brocade** visible
- Plaque: "Vera Ostrega, Who Kept the Garden"

**Portrait 7: The Explorer (Rendall Ostrega)**
- Map case has **wave pattern** tooled into leather
- Plaque: "Rendall Ostrega, Who Sailed Beyond"

**Portrait 8: The Healer (????? Ostrega)**
- Apron has scattered **small flower** embroidery
- Plaque: The name has been **scratched out**. Only dates remain: "??? Ostrega, 847-901 OZ"

### The Puzzle

**Solution:** Match each textile swatch to its correct portrait bracket based on visual clues in the paintings.

**The Investigation:** 
- DC 12 Perception to notice the patterns on clothing/accessories in portraits
- DC 14 Investigation to confidently match a specific textile
- Characters can study and discuss without penalty — only placing swatches triggers checks

### The Trap for Liir

The eighth portrait — The Healer — has its name scratched out. The figure's features are subtly *different* from the other Ostregas: the bone structure is wrong, the skin tone slightly off.

This is the fraudulent branch. Liir's false great-grandmother.

If Liir examines this portrait (DC 14 Insight, or automatic if he specifically looks for family resemblance), he recognizes the face. This is the woman his family claims connects them to the Ostregas. She looks nothing like the others.

**The Dilemma:**
- If he places the **sparse flowers** swatch under her portrait → He validates the lie. The seal completes, but Viridian *knows*. She smiles.
- If he argues the portrait doesn't belong → The puzzle cannot complete unless they leave that bracket empty, which requires someone to realize the family tree has a fraud in it.

**Secret Solution:** Leave the eighth bracket **empty**. The seal breaks when they acknowledge that not all who claim the name deserve it.

### Viridian's Probing

*"Such a noble lineage. So many branches. Tell me, Liir — do you see your resemblance to any of them? Which branch do you descend from?"* (Watching his face when he looks at the Healer)

### Failure Mechanic

**Wrong Swatch Placed:** The portrait *weeps* — blood-tears streak down the painted face. The player who placed it makes a **DC 13 Wisdom save** or takes **1d8 psychic damage** and sees a flash of that ancestor's death. On a success, just the vision, no damage.

**After 3 Failures:** The portraits begin *whispering* — accusations, disappointments, family secrets. All characters have **disadvantage on Wisdom checks** in this room until a short rest. One portrait speaks directly to Liir: *"You're not one of us. We can tell."*

### Reward
One character gains **Death's Denial** (first time at 0 HP, stabilize automatically).

# SEAL 3: NATURE
## The Library

### Read Aloud
> Floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books of every size and age. The smell of old paper and leather hangs heavy in the air. A rolling ladder leans against one shelf, its wheels rusted in place. 
>
> Reading desks are positioned throughout — one holds an open journal, another a magnifying glass and a collection of specimen jars. The jars contain preserved creatures: a bird, a mouse, a snake, each floating in amber liquid. There's something unsettling about their eyes.
>
> Thousands of spines in dozens of colors. Some sections are organized (History, Botany, Geography), others seem random. Near the fireplace, a comfortable reading chair faces away from the door, its back high enough to hide whoever might be sitting in it.
>
> A brass plaque near the door reads: *"The Speakers are shelved among the silent. Find them, and they will show you the way."*

### Key Features

**The Books.** Thousands of volumes. Most are ordinary — histories, novels, scientific treatises. But hidden among them are **four specific books about Animals** (capital A).

**The Hidden Books:**
- "Memoirs of a Badger Councillor" — History section, spine is brown leather, title barely legible
- "Wren Poetry: An Anthology" — Literature section, small green volume, pressed between larger books
- "The Foxwood Debates: Transcripts" — Philosophy section, red cloth binding, dusty
- "Ambassador Kinderly's Letters Home" — Correspondence section, blue leather, gilt edges

**Inside Each Book:** A torn piece of parchment tucked into the pages. Together, the four pieces form the **Seal of Nature sigil** — a circular design showing a creature looking into a mirror.

### The Puzzle

**Solution:**
1. Find all four Animal books among the shelves
2. Remove the sigil pieces from each book
3. Assemble the four pieces to form the complete sigil
4. **Trace the completed sigil** — either in the air, or on the table, or drawn on paper

When traced correctly, the sigil glows briefly and the seal breaks. The fireplace flares green.

**Finding the Books:**
- DC 14 Investigation to find one book through systematic searching
- Each book takes roughly 10 minutes to find without magical assistance
- Characters can split up and search different sections
- *Locate Object* finds all four immediately

### The Trap for Frederick

Frederick recognizes these books immediately. These aren't books *about* animals — they're books *by* Animals. Written by sentient beings. The Badger was a real councillor. Ambassador Kinderly was a real diplomat.

If Frederick finds them quickly or knows exactly where to look, other characters may wonder how a "simple Munchkinlander clerk" is so familiar with Animal literature.

**If Asked How He Knew:**
- If he lies convincingly (Deception DC 14), he's safe but Viridian notices the lie
- If he tells the truth, his secret is exposed
- If he hesitates too long, Viridian helps: *"Frederick seems so certain. Almost as if he's read these before. Have you spent time with Animal communities, Frederick?"*

### Viridian's Probing

*"Such keen eyes. You found those so quickly. Almost as if you've spent time among... their kind."* (Watching for his reaction)

*"The Animals in the specimen jars — do you find it sad? How they're preserved here, neither alive nor dead, unable to be themselves?"* (Testing if he reacts to "unable to be themselves")

### Failure Mechanic

**Wrong Book Pulled:** A spectral hand erupts from the shelf and slams the book back, hard. The player makes a **DC 12 Strength save** or is pushed 10 feet backward and knocked prone. Either way, they take **1d6 force damage**.

"Wrong books" are any books that seem like they might be about animals but aren't Animal-authored: "Natural History of Oz," "Fauna of the Eastern Forests," "Beastiary of the Vinkus," etc.

**After 3 Failures:** The shelves **rearrange themselves**. All progress is lost. The four correct books are now in different locations. The library will not allow random guessing. A whispered voice says: *"If you cannot recognize the Speakers, you do not deserve to hear them."*

### Reward
One character gains a **True Sight Token** (advantage on one Insight check, once).

# SEAL 4: SERVICE
## The Servant Quarters → Yackle's Study

### Read Aloud (Servant Quarters)
> A row of small beds lines one wall, each neatly made with threadbare blankets. Hooks on the wall hold uniforms — maid's dresses, butler's coats, all in the same faded green. A duty roster is pinned to a board near the door, listing tasks and names in neat columns.
>
> Personal effects sit on small shelves beside each bed: a comb, a prayer book, a child's drawing. The room feels lived in, but there's no dust. Someone has been maintaining this.
>
> On a small table between two beds sits a **worn deck of cards**, clearly well-used. A leather-bound **notebook** lies beside it, open to a page of careful handwriting.
>
> Above the table, a **bell board** shows a row of bells, each labeled with a room: Library, Parlor, Chapel, Master Bedroom, Study, Dining Room, Kitchen, Gallery. One bell — the one labeled "Study" — is stuck in the "rung" position. It makes no sound, but it never stops trembling.

### The Notebook

**HANDOUT: Servant's Daily Rounds**

*Cover page:*
> "A Servant's Guide to the House
> For Training New Staff
> —Willem, Head Butler"

*First relevant page:*
> "The Daily Round
> 
> The house must be served in proper order, as the Mistress requires. Begin at dawn and follow this sequence without deviation.
>
> First: The CHAPEL. Light the morning candles, air the incense, open the prayer book to the day's reading. The spirit must be tended before the body.
>
> Second: The KITCHEN. Stoke the fires, begin the bread, set water to boil. A house runs on its stomach.
>
> Third: The LIBRARY. Open curtains, dust the reading desk, check that no books were left open overnight (the Mistress is particular about this). The mind awakens with the day.
>
> Fourth: The PARLOR. Lay the fire (do not light — that is the Mistress's preference), plump cushions, wind the clock. Guests may arrive at any hour.
>
> Fifth: The DINING ROOM. Polish the silver, set for breakfast, arrange the flowers (if available). Presentation matters.
>
> Sixth: The GALLERY. Check for dust (especially the frames), ensure curtains are drawn against the morning sun (the paintings must be protected). The ancestors watch always.
>
> Seventh: The MASTER BEDROOM. Last, and only when the Mistress has risen. Change linens, empty the basin, open windows briefly. Privacy above all.
>
> Eighth: The STUDY. This room is never to be entered without summons. If the bell rings, attend immediately. Otherwise, the Study tends itself.
>
> The round takes approximately four hours. By noon, the house is ready to receive."

*Later page:*
> "On the Cards
>
> We play to pass the time when duties are complete. Mira taught us a game where each card represents a room, and we must play them in the order of the round. It helps the new ones learn.
>
> Ace of Spades — Chapel (the highest, the spirit)
> Two of Hearts — Kitchen (the hearth, the warmth)  
> Three of Clubs — Library (the clover, for luck in learning)
> Four of Diamonds — Parlor (the gem, for guests)
> Five of Hearts — Dining Room (where we share)
> Six of Spades — Gallery (the ancestors, serious as spades)
> Seven of Diamonds — Master Bedroom (seven for rest, diamonds for the Mistress)
> Eight of Clubs — Study (eight for completion, clubs because we never go there)
>
> Play them in order, and the day goes smooth. Play them wrong, and Willem scolds."

### The Puzzle

**Setup:** The deck of cards sits ready. The bell for the Study trembles, unanswered.

**Solution:**
1. Read the notebook to learn the service order
2. Find the eight specific cards in the deck
3. Lay them out in the correct sequence:
   - A♠ → 2♥ → 3♣ → 4♦ → 5♥ → 6♠ → 7♦ → 8♣
4. When laid correctly, the trembling bell stills, and a soft chime sounds from the Study upstairs

**Second Part:** Go to the Study. The door, previously locked, now opens. Inside, on Yackle's desk, a candle has lit itself. A voice whispers: *"Thank you for answering. It has been so long since anyone came when called."*

The seal breaks when someone says, aloud: *"I'm here. What do you need?"*

### The Trap for Shell

Shell recognizes this immediately. The daily round. The prayer candles first. The hierarchy of service. She lived this for fifteen years.

If she takes the lead on this puzzle, Viridian notices: *"You seem very familiar with servant's routines, Sister. I thought maunteries had different schedules. More... contemplative?"*

If Shell explains, she reveals her mauntery background was more domestic than spiritual — she was a servant in a religious house, not a contemplative nun. This is embarrassing, not damning. But it opens the door to more questions about why she left.

### Viridian's Probing

*"Such faithful service, tending a house for centuries. And what did they receive for their loyalty? Their names on a roster, forgotten by all. Does that sound familiar to anyone?"* (Watching Shell's face)

*"The notebook mentions the Staff were 'particular' about the Study. I wonder what secrets they kept for the Mistress. What secrets have you kept, Shell?"*

### Failure Mechanic

**Wrong Card Sequence:** All eight cards flip face-down simultaneously, and a bell rings harshly. The player who laid the last card makes a **DC 13 Constitution save** or is **deafened for 1 minute**. The cards scatter and must be re-gathered from the deck.

**After 3 Failures:** The cards fly from the table and arrange themselves in the air, spinning slowly, showing the sequence for three seconds before collapsing. A hint — but also a judgment: *"Even children learn faster than this."* For the next hour, all Service-related ability checks (Insight, Persuasion when serving others, etc.) are made with **disadvantage** by anyone who was in the room.

### Reward
One character gains **Swift Aid** (Help action as bonus action for rest of session).

# SEAL 5: SACRIFICE
## The Chapel

### Read Aloud
> Eight stained glass windows line the walls of this small chapel, each depicting a different scene in brilliant colors that somehow glow despite the darkness outside. A river of time. A tree of roots intertwined. A creature seeing its reflection. The images are old, older than Unionist tradition.
>
> Wooden pews face a simple altar of white stone. Above the altar, instead of a religious symbol, there is only a blank space — a deliberate emptiness. An **offering bowl** sits on the altar's surface, tarnished silver, conspicuously empty. Beneath the bowl, carved into the stone: *"To see the light, you must first give it."*
>
> Near the windows, an **ornate stand** holds a **brass telescope**, pointed at nothing in particular — the sky is clouded tonight. Beside it, a **velvet cushion** displays an **astronomical chart** showing stars that don't match Oz's sky.
>
> Against one wall, a **prayer kneeler** with a worn cushion faces a small icon — a single open hand releasing a bird. A **hymnal** sits on the kneeler, open to a song titled "What We Give Away."
>
> On a narrow **side table**, three **unlit candles** of different sizes stand in brass holders. Matches are nowhere to be seen. A small **hourglass** shows sand still flowing. A **prayer book** lies closed, its cover embossed with eight interlocking circles.
>
> The air smells faintly of incense that hasn't burned in decades.

### Key Features

**The Telescope.** Brass, well-made, old. On its stand facing the clouded windows. Looking through it shows nothing — the sky is dark, the clouds thick.

If examined closely (DC 14 Investigation, or automatic if someone tries to adjust/clean it): The telescope *unscrews in the middle*. Inside the barrel, wrapped in oilcloth, is a **small box of wooden matches**.

A note wrapped with the matches reads: *"I hid these so I would have to look. So I would have to take something apart to find them. You cannot give light until you stop looking outward."*

**The Candles.** Three unlit candles on the side table. Any attempt to light them with magic (Prestidigitation, Fire Bolt, Produce Flame) fails — the flame appears then immediately dies. A whispered voice says: *"That cost you nothing."*

**The Offering Bowl.** Tarnished silver. Empty. Placing objects in it does nothing — coins, gems, weapons all sit inert. A character who places something truly personal (a letter, a keepsake, something with emotional weight) feels a warmth, but the seal doesn't break.

**The Altar Inscription.** *"To see the light, you must first give it."*

**The Prayer Kneeler.** Worn from use. A DC 12 Religion check identifies the icon (open hand releasing a bird) as an ancient Lurlinite symbol of sacrifice — not blood sacrifice, but *letting go*.

**The Hymnal.** Open to "What We Give Away." The lyrics speak of light given freely, darkness held too tightly, and the difference between *trading* and *gifting*.

### The Puzzle

**The Real Solution:**
1. Find the matches hidden in the telescope
2. Light the **real candle** on your actual gaming table
3. The player must physically strike the match and light an actual candle

When the real candle is lit, the three in-game candles light themselves in response. The offering bowl fills with soft light. The seal breaks.

**Why This Works:**
- Taking apart the telescope = stopping the search for external answers
- Finding matches hidden inside = discovering you had what you needed all along
- Lighting a real candle = actually giving something (effort, action, fire) rather than just describing it
- The sacrifice is *attention* and *presence* — being here, now, acting in reality

### The Trap for Sarima

Sarima's instinct is to trade. She'll want to place something valuable in the bowl and get the seal in return. She'll try to light the candles with her pact magic.

The bowl rejects transactions. The magic fails.

If she searches the telescope or kneels at the prayer station, Viridian comments: *"Looking for a deal, Sarima? Something to trade? That's how it works in the Vinkus, isn't it? Everything has a price. Even magic."*

Sarima must watch someone else solve this puzzle by simply *giving* — no deal, no return, just action.

### Viridian's Probing

*"The Arjiki are famous for their bargains. Blood oaths, favor trades, debt-bonds. Tell me, Sarima — when you first felt magic, was it given to you? Or did you... negotiate for it?"*

*"One learns to give gracefully. Or one learns to take carefully. Which did you learn, I wonder?"*

### Failure Mechanic

**Magical Lighting Attempted:** The flame appears, flickers beautifully, then dies. No save, no damage — just failure. The voice repeats: *"That cost you nothing."* After 3 magical attempts, magic no longer affects the candles at all.

**Wrong Object in Bowl:** The bowl tips, dumping the object onto the floor. If the object was genuinely valuable (gems, weapons, gold), the player feels a sharp pang of shame (no mechanical effect, just narrative weight). The bowl rights itself and waits.

**After 3 Wrong Objects:** The bowl speaks directly: *"I cannot be bought. I cannot be bribed. I was made to receive gifts, not payments. Do you understand the difference?"*

### Reward
One character gains **Last Strike** (when dropped to 0 HP, make one free attack).

# SEAL 6: DEED
## The Hall of Mirrors

### Read Aloud
> Mirrors line both walls of this long corridor, dozens of them in ornate frames — gilt and silver, carved wood and plain iron. But they don't reflect what's in front of them. Or rather, they don't reflect it *correctly*.
>
> One mirror shows you younger. Another shows you older. One shows you in different clothes. One shows nothing at all, just empty glass where your reflection should be.
>
> As you step into the hall, the mirrors begin to *change*. They show things that haven't happened yet. Things that have happened and you'd rather forget. A moment of triumph. A moment of shame. Your hands doing something you swore you'd never do.
>
> At the far end of the hall, larger than the others, hangs the **True Mirror** — its frame carved with vines that might be flowers or might be thorns. Beneath it, a small **pedestal** holds nothing but a velvet cushion, empty, waiting.
>
> On a table near the entrance sits a **masquerade mask** — elegant, white porcelain with gold filigree, designed to hide the upper half of the face. It's beautiful. It would hide everything above the mouth.
>
> Above the True Mirror, carved into the wall: *"Only the unmasked may pass."*

### Key Features

**The Lesser Mirrors.** Each shows something different:
- **Mirror of Youth:** The character at their happiest, their most innocent
- **Mirror of Age:** The character old, tired, marked by time
- **Mirror of Fear:** What they're afraid of becoming
- **Mirror of Hope:** What they wish they could become
- **Mirror of Death:** Their end, shadowy and unclear, disturbing
- **Mirror of Absence:** Nothing — no reflection at all, deeply unsettling
- **Mirror of Others:** How others see them (often unflattering)
- **Mirror of Self:** How they see themselves (often kinder than truth)

**The True Mirror.** At the end of the hall. It shows what the character has **DONE**. Not what they look like, not what they fear or hope — their *actions*. Specific. Detailed. Unkind.

**The Mask.** White porcelain, gold filigree. Beautiful. Designed to hide.

**The Pedestal.** Empty velvet cushion beneath the True Mirror.

### The Puzzle

**The Solution (Full Version):**
1. One character picks up the masquerade mask
2. They PUT ON the mask
3. They walk the length of the hall, seeing their reflections in every mirror
4. They stand before the True Mirror
5. They REMOVE the mask
6. While holding the mask, looking into the True Mirror, they say aloud: *"That is me. I did that."*
7. They place the mask on the pedestal
8. The seal breaks. All mirrors shatter simultaneously.

**Why This Works:**
- Putting on the mask = acknowledging we all wear masks, hide from truth
- Walking the hall = confronting the many selves we create and fear
- Removing the mask = choosing to be seen, despite everything
- Speaking the acknowledgment = taking responsibility, not excusing
- Placing the mask down = letting go of the need to hide

### What the True Mirror Shows (By Character)

**Averic:** Hands forging documents. The face of Professor Klees, disappointed. A library of lies with Averic's name on every spine.

**Liir:** A family tree with his branch drawn in different ink. Faces of real Ostregas turning away from him. An empty chair at a table where he doesn't belong.

**Frederick:** A fox removing human clothes. Underground meetings. Forged papers burning. The faces of Animals he failed to save.

**Sarima:** A dark shape receiving her desperate prayer. The moment of the bargain. Her brother's face, healed but *wrong* somehow. Her own hands doing things she doesn't remember deciding.

**Shell:** Empty mauntery halls. Documents being destroyed. Her own face, speaking accusations no one heard. The door slamming behind her.

**Mareth:** A village burning. Children's faces. His soldiers following orders he didn't quite give but didn't stop. Bodies in rows. His own face, unchanged, walking away.

**Seven:** This is complicated. Seven sees... themselves. Being made. The moment of awakening. The question that has no answer: *What am I?* And beneath it, hunger — impossible hunger for something a construct shouldn't want.

**Viridian/Yackle:** She WILL NOT enter this hall until forced. The True Mirror would show her true face. If somehow compelled to look, she sees: A thousand masks, worn and discarded. Faces of those who died in this house. A woman, young, green-skinned, hopeful — buried under centuries of lies. And beneath it all: I LOVE U, carved desperately into every surface.

### The Trap for Mareth

Mareth knows what the True Mirror will show. He's spent thirty years not looking at it.

If he's the one to complete the seal, he must stand before the mirror and watch the massacre play out. The children. The order he didn't give but didn't stop. The bodies.

And he must say: *"That is me. I did that."*

Not "I was following orders." Not "It was war." Not "I had no choice."

Just: That is me. I did that.

**If Mareth Cannot:** Another character can complete the seal with their own deeds. But Mareth will know he failed to take responsibility. And Viridian will know too.

### Viridian's Probing

She will NOT enter the Hall of Mirrors. If pressed, she claims claustrophobia, discomfort, headaches.

**DC 16 Insight:** She's not uncomfortable — she's *afraid*. Of the mirrors. Of being seen.

If Mareth hesitates at the True Mirror, she calls from the doorway: *"Some deeds cannot be spoken, Captain. Some things are better left... masked. Don't you think?"*

She's not helping. She's testing whether he'll take the excuse.

### Failure Mechanic

**Trying to Cheat (placing mask without wearing it, speaking without looking, etc.):** The mask flies from their hands and attaches to their face. **DC 14 Strength** to remove it. While wearing the attached mask, they see ONLY their worst deed in every reflective surface — mirrors, windows, water, metal, other characters' eyes.

**Walking the Hall Without the Mask:** The mirrors show the character's deeds to EVERYONE. No privacy. What they did plays out for all to see. No save, no recourse — the hall demands honesty.

**After 3 Failed Attempts:** The True Mirror speaks: *"You hide. You excuse. You explain. But you will not simply* say it.*"* All characters in the hall make a **DC 14 Wisdom save** or are **frightened** of mirrors for 1 hour (disadvantage on all checks within 10 feet of a reflective surface).

### Reward
One character gains a **Resolve Token** (reroll one failed saving throw, once).

# SEAL 7: HUNGER
## The Dining Room

### Read Aloud
> A long table dominates this room, set for eight with fine china and tarnished silver. Candelabras line the center, their candles unlit. Each place setting has a name card — not names, but descriptions.
>
> "The Scholar Who Forged."
> "The Heir Without Blood."  
> "The Beast in Human Skin."
> "The Debt-Bound."
> "The Faithful Betrayed."
> "The Widow Who Watches."
> "The Soldier Unmarked."
> "The Construct That Hungers."
>
> The chair at the head of the table is larger, throne-like, conspicuously empty. A ninth setting waits there, no name card at all.
>
> A sideboard holds covered dishes that steam gently, as if dinner was just served. The smell of food is overwhelming — rich, savory, impossible to identify but deeply, personally appealing.
>
> Above the empty chair, carved into the wall: *"Before you may leave, you must say what you want."*

### The Setup

This seal cannot be attempted until all other seals are broken. The final test.

When all eight characters are seated (in any arrangement), the candles light themselves. The door closes. A voice fills the room — not Yackle's voice, but the house itself:

*"You have proven your worth. One trial remains. Answer truthfully: What do you truly want?"*

### The Puzzle

**The Rules:**
1. Each character must answer the question: "What do you truly want?"
2. The seal magic **compels honesty** — lies cause 2d6 psychic damage
3. Deflection or silence causes 1d6 psychic damage per round
4. Each character must answer before the seal can break
5. When the last character answers, the seal breaks

**The Trap:**
Everyone must answer. Including Viridian.

### What They Want (For GM Reference)

**Averic:** To be recognized. To matter. To have his work acknowledged, even if it's built on lies.

**Liir:** To belong somewhere. To have a family, a lineage, a place where he's not pretending.

**Frederick:** To stop hiding. To live as himself. To see Animals free.

**Sarima:** To be free of the debt. To know what she traded. To have her magic be *hers*.

**Shell:** To believe again. To trust that her faith wasn't wasted. To be welcomed back.

**Mareth:** To be punished. Or to be forgiven. Either would be better than this.

**Seven:** To understand what they are. To know if they're real. To *want* — because constructs shouldn't want, but Seven does.

**Viridian/Yackle:** *"I want... to stop. To finally be known. To end."*

### The Reveal

When Viridian answers, she cannot lie. And for the first time in a thousand years, she speaks truth:

*"I want to stop. I want to be seen. I want..."* 

Her face flickers. Her voice changes — older, rougher, tired beyond measure.

*"I want to end. To finally, finally end."*

Her disguise fails. Her skin grays. Her eyes go ancient.

The REVEAL happens.

### The Trap for Seven

Seven must answer what they want. But constructs don't want — they're built, programmed, directed.

Except Seven *does* want. They've always known something was wrong with them. And now they must say it aloud.

*"I want... to be real. I want to matter. I want someone to..."*

Whatever Seven says, Viridian (before her reveal) responds: *"Yes. That's what I want too."*

A moment of connection. Then her face changes.

### Failure Mechanic

**Lying:** 2d6 psychic damage, and the truth spills out anyway — the house extracts it.

**Refusing to Answer:** 1d6 psychic damage per round of silence. The pressure builds. Eventually, everyone breaks.

**Trying to Leave:** The doors are sealed. No escape. Even Dimension Door fails — the room is a closed space, magically isolated.

**There is no "After 3 Failures":** This puzzle cannot be brute-forced. It requires truth or it requires pain until truth emerges. The only way forward is honesty.

### Reward
One character gains **Second Wind** (recover one spent Hit Die).

**But also:** The battle begins. Yackle reveals herself. The third act starts.
