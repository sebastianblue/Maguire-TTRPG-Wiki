<h1>Domingon Tradition Spells</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"In trance, we walk between worlds. In rhythm, we speak with spirits. In blood, we honor the ancestors."</p>

<p>The Domingon tradition is the mystical practice of the Quadling people, blending ancestral worship, spirit communion, and trance magic. Unlike the rigid hierarchies of Grimmerie or Unionist magic, Domingon draws power from collective ritual, ancestral memory, and the liminal spaces between waking and dreaming.</p>

<p>This tradition is primarily accessible to <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-adept', 'The Adept'); return false;">Adepts</a> who choose the Domingon tradition, <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/races/humans/quadling', 'Quadling'); return false;">Quadling</a> characters with cultural background, and certain <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'The Witch'); return false;">Witches</a> who have learned from Quadling practitioners.</p>

<p>These spells are unique to the Domingon tradition and cannot be learned through other magical traditions without explicit training from a Quadling spirit-walker.</p>

<h3>Ritual of the Red River (6th Circle)</h3>

<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour<br>

<li>When one participant takes damage, each other participant can choose to take up to half that damage to reduce the original damage by the same amount</li>
<li>Participants have advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened while within 60 feet of each other</li>

<h3>Dance of the Dead (7th Circle)</h3>

<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br>

When the spell ends or a corpse drops to 0 hit points, the spirit departs peacefully.</p>

<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>

<p>Domingon magic is inseparable from Quadling culture. The tradition emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> Many spells are more powerful when cast with multiple participants</li>
<li><strong>Respect:</strong> Spirits must be approached with proper ritual and offerings</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> The dead are not gone; they remain accessible through trance and ritual</li>
<li><strong>Liminality:</strong> Power comes from walking between worlds—waking/dreaming, living/dead, material/spiritual</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Domingon Magic</h2>

<p>Unlike <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('magic/spells/grimmerie-tradition', 'Grimmerie Tradition'); return false;">Grimmerie magic</a> which can be learned from books, Domingon magic requires personal instruction from a spirit-walker or participation in Quadling community rituals. Non-Quadlings who learn this tradition often do so through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended time living in Quadling communities</li>
<li>Marriage or adoption into Quadling families</li>
<li>Being chosen by ancestral spirits in dreams</li>
<li>Rescue or aid given to Quadling people, earning their trust</li>
</ul>

<h2>GM Notes</h2>

<h3>Ritual Requirements</h3>
<p>Many Domingon spells benefit from or require ritual casting. Consider requiring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drums, rattles, or other percussion instruments</li>
<li>Ritual body paint or scarification</li>
<li>Circle of participants (even if they're not spellcasters)</li>
<li>Blood offerings (minor cuts, not life-threatening)</li>
<li>Specific moon phases or times of day</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spirit Interaction</h3>
<p>Ancestral spirits in Domingon magic are not mere spell effects—they're characters. Give them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinct personalities based on their lives</li>
<li>Opinions about current events and how the living honor the dead</li>
<li>Willingness to help or refuse based on proper respect being shown</li>
<li>Cultural knowledge from their era</li>
</ul>

<h3>Political Context</h3>
<p>In the Wizard's Oz, Domingon magic is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewed with suspicion by Emerald City authorities</li>
<li>Tolerated in Quadling Country but monitored</li>
<li>Sometimes confused with <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'Witch'); return false;">Witchcraft</a> by ignorant officials</li>
<li>A source of cultural resistance and Quadling identity</li>
<li>Increasingly rare as younger Quadlings assimilate to Emerald City culture</li>
</ul>
