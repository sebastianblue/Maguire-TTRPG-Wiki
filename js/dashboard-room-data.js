  "approach": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe carriage path winds through overgrown hedges that might once have been sculpted into fanciful shapes\u2014Animals, perhaps, or scenes from Ozian mythology. Now they're just walls of tangled green, pressing close on either side. The fog thickens as you approach, and the temperature drops noticeably. Ahead, iron gates stand open, and beyond them, the manor rises against a bruised purple sky. It's larger than you expected. The architecture is old Gillikinese\u2014all steep gables and narrow windows\u2014but something about the proportions feels wrong. The angles don't quite meet where they should.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Gates.</strong> Wrought iron, standing open. Once a character passes through, they swing shut silently and will not open again by any means. The lock cannot be picked (no DC\u2014simply impossible). A <em>knock</em> spell causes the gates to shudder but not open. Attempting to climb over results in the character finding themselves back on the inside.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Hedges.</strong> A DC 14 Nature check reveals these were once shaped like Animals\u2014Lions, Bears, a great Eagle. Now they're wild, but the shapes are still vaguely visible if you know to look.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One hedge shows a Fox mid-leap, frozen in topiary. The eyes seem to follow Frederick if he's present.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the base of the Lion hedge: \"For those who cannot speak, I gave voice. For those who were unseen, I made them seen. \u2014L.T.\" (Lurline's Testament)</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The hedges radiate faint abjuration magic\u2014they're a ward, keeping something in or something out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Fog.</strong> Extends about 20 feet beyond the walls. A character who enters the fog must make a DC 15 Constitution save each round or begin suffocating. After three failed saves, they fall unconscious and are expelled back onto the estate grounds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> Shapes move in the fog\u2014humanoid, but wrong. They never get closer.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The fog is not natural weather\u2014it's solidified memory, fragments of past events made semi-physical.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Carriage Path.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Survival DC 12:</strong> No wheel ruts, no hoof prints. No one has used this path in decades. Except... there ARE fresh footprints. Eight sets. Leading in. None leading out.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The footprints match the party's boots exactly, down to the wear patterns. They were here before you arrived.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",
  "cemetery": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA low iron fence surrounds a small family plot to the west of the main house. The headstones are old\u2014some cracked, some sunken into the earth\u2014but the names are still legible. OSTREGA, they all read. Generations of them. The newest stone looks perhaps a century old. There are fresh flowers on one grave, impossibly fresh, as if placed this morning. But no one has lived here in decades.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Headstones.</strong> The Ostrega family burial plot. A DC 12 History check reveals the Ostregas were a minor Gillikinese family who died out about a century ago\u2014no living descendants. Liir's player may find this concerning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The dates are wrong. \"Yael Ostrega, 621-643\" is carved on one stone, but another stone fifty feet away reads \"Yael Ostrega, 804-831.\" The same name, two centuries apart.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion DC 14:</strong> The grave markers use both Lurlinite and Unionist symbols, sometimes on the same stone\u2014theologically impossible. Someone was hedging their bets about the afterlife.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One grave is sunken differently than the others\u2014deeper, as if something much larger than a body is buried there. The headstone reads simply: \"The First Mask.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Fresh Flowers.</strong> On the grave of \"Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter.\" A DC 14 Investigation check finds that the flowers are real but have no roots\u2014they're simply placed here. A DC 16 Arcana check reveals faint necromantic magic. Someone has been maintaining this grave.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 12:</strong> These are ghost-breath flowers, which only bloom in the presence of the dead. But they're blooming at the wrong angle\u2014toward the house, not the grave.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The flowers are an offering, but also an apology. Someone has been saying sorry for a very long time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Gravestone Rubbing.</strong> If a character makes a rubbing of any headstone, provide a physical handout showing the Ostrega family crest (a key crossed with a quill) and dates spanning from 600s to 900s OZ calendar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Iron Fence.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 11:</strong> The fence posts are topped with finials shaped like eyes\u2014dozens of them, all facing inward, watching the graves.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Scratched into the back of one fence post, nearly invisible: \"She visits every night. She never speaks. \u2014Groundskeeper William, 788\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",
  "foyer": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe front doors open onto a grand entrance hall. A crystal chandelier hangs overhead, unlit, its hundreds of pendants catching what little moonlight filters through the high windows. A sweeping staircase curves upward to the left, while doorways lead off in three directions. The floor is checkered marble\u2014green and white\u2014worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. A grandfather clock stands against the far wall, its pendulum still. In the center of the room, someone has arranged eight chairs in a circle around a small table bearing a single leather case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Chandelier.</strong> If a character looks closely (Perception DC 12), they notice the crystals are not glass but some kind of green stone. A DC 15 Arcana check identifies them as emeralds\u2014a fortune's worth. However, any attempt to remove them causes them to crumble to worthless powder.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The chandelier has exactly 808 crystals. Why that specific number? A DC 16 History check recalls 808 OZ is the year the Wizard came to power.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> One crystal is a different color\u2014blood red. It hangs directly above the empty ninth chair at the head of the circle.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The chandelier isn't just decorative\u2014it's a massive scrying focus. Someone could watch the entire ground floor from this central point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Grandfather Clock.</strong> The clock shows 11:47\u2014always 11:47, regardless of the actual time. It has no visible winding mechanism. At midnight (real time, or when dramatically appropriate), it chimes thirteen times. This signals the First Twist.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The clock face has thirteen hours marked, not twelve. The thirteenth hour is labeled with a symbol instead of a number\u2014an eye.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Faint scratches inside the clock cabinet: tally marks. Hundreds of them. Someone was counting something for a very long time.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The clock doesn't measure time\u2014it measures proximity to a specific event. It's waiting for something.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Chairs.</strong> Eight chairs, each with a name card on the seat. The names are not the characters' names but epithets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"The One Who Rewrote the Past\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Claims False Blood\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Denies Their Nature\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Whose Service Was Punished\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Traded Instead of Gave\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Whose Deed Did Not Transform Them\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Hungers When They Should Not\"</li>\n<li>\"The One Who Has Never Been Seen\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Place Cards.</strong> Provide physical cards with these epithets. Let players figure out which card belongs to whom.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 14:</strong> These aren't accusations\u2014they're descriptions. Whoever wrote these knows each character intimately.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The handwriting on all eight cards is identical, written with the same pen, same ink pressure. They were all written at the same time, by someone who expected exactly these eight people.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> There's a ninth chair, larger than the others, at the head of the circle. It has no name card.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Leather Case.</strong> Contains the will. Mr. Trism will open it and read it when all eight heirs are present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Staircase.</strong> Leads to the upper floors. Until the First Twist, the stairs seem to go on forever\u2014characters who climb find themselves back at the bottom. After the clock chimes, the upper floors become accessible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 12:</strong> The stairs are worn in the middle, but not evenly. The wear pattern suggests someone walking up and down the same section repeatedly\u2014pacing, not traveling.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Carved into the underside of the seventh step, invisible unless you duck underneath: \"Day 217. Still here. Still alone. Still waiting. \u2014Y.O.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Marble Floor.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The green and white pattern isn't random\u2014it forms a massive eight-pointed star with the chair circle at its center.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> This pattern is a summoning circle, but inverted. It's not calling something here\u2014it's keeping something from leaving.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",
  "parlor": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nA comfortable sitting room with faded elegance. Two sofas face each other across a low table, upholstered in purple velvet worn thin at the armrests. A fireplace dominates one wall\u2014cold now, but logs are laid ready to burn. Above the mantle hangs a portrait of a woman in old-fashioned dress, her face obscured by a crack in the canvas that runs directly through her features. Against the far wall, a drinks cabinet stands open, bottles of amber and crimson liquid glinting in the low light. A chess board sits on a side table, mid-game.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Fireplace.</strong> If anyone expresses a desire for warmth (verbal or otherwise), the fire ignites itself without fuel or spark. This is the first sign the house responds to its occupants. The fire provides normal warmth and light but cannot be used to burn anything\u2014objects placed in it simply sit there, unharmed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The logs in the hearth are made of stone, expertly carved to look like wood. They've never been real.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Soot stains on the mantle spell out words if you step back and squint: \"WARM BODIES COLD HEART\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The fire is transmutation magic, converting loneliness into heat. The more isolated a character feels, the warmer the fire burns for them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Portrait.</strong> Originally depicted Yackle in her mortal days. The crack appeared when she was first bound. A DC 16 Investigation check around the frame reveals a small plaque, nearly painted over: \"Y.O., Age 23.\" A <em>mending</em> spell repairs the crack but reveals only a blank face\u2014smooth, featureless, like an unfinished painting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The portrait's eyes were painted, then scraped out, then repainted, then scraped out again. This happened dozens of times\u2014someone couldn't decide if they wanted to see or be seen.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The woman in the portrait (before the crack) looks hopeful. Genuinely, achingly hopeful. Whatever happened to create that crack destroyed something irreplaceable.</li>\n<li><strong>History DC 15:</strong> The dress style is from approximately 650 OZ\u2014over 300 years ago. But the paint is much older. Someone updated the portrait but kept the pose.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Drinks Cabinet.</strong> Contains wine and spirits that are safe to consume. A DC 14 Investigation check finds a hidden compartment containing a small vial labeled \"For When It Becomes Too Much\"\u2014this is a <em>potion of dreamless sleep</em> (8 hours of unconsciousness, no dreams, no external force can wake the drinker).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> Seven glasses are set out, each with a thin layer of dust. One glass is clean, recently used.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Inside the \"dreamless sleep\" vial, scratched into the glass with a diamond: \"Coward's way out. Won't work anyway. Tried.\" </li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 13:</strong> The bottles rearrange themselves when no one is looking. The house is... offering? Suggesting?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Chess Game.</strong> Mid-game, white is winning. A DC 12 Intelligence check recognizes it as a famous historical match\u2014the \"Ozma Gambit,\" supposedly played between Queen Ozma and the first Wizard. The game was never finished; Ozma disappeared before the final move. The white queen is positioned to checkmate in one move.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Ozma Gambit.</strong> A note tucked under the chess board explaining the game's history. The final move was never made. Someone has written in the margin: <em>\"She always knew how to win. She just chose not to.\"</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> There's a second note, older, in different handwriting: \"I've been playing both sides for so long I've forgotten which color I started as. Does it matter if you're always alone?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One of the black pieces (a knight) has a tiny crack, recently repaired with gold\u2014the Gillikinese art of kintsugi. Someone values broken things.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> White could win in one move, but hasn't. Black could forfeit and end the stalemate, but hasn't. The game is frozen in possibility\u2014neither player wants it to end, because ending means admitting you played alone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Sofas.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The wear patterns show two people sitting across from each other regularly\u2014but the impressions are identical in depth and age. One person, sitting in both places, having a conversation with themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Tucked between sofa cushions: a child's drawing of two stick figures holding hands. One is labeled \"Me\" and the other is labeled \"Friend?\" The question mark is heavily traced, as if questioned many times.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",
  "music-room": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nInstruments line the walls of this circular room\u2014a harp with broken strings, a violin in a glass case, a set of Quadling drums. Dominating the space is a grand piano, its lid open, keys yellowed with age. Sheet music is scattered across every surface: the piano bench, the floor, tucked into instrument cases. A mechanical music box sits on a pedestal near the window, ornate and clearly valuable. The moonlight catches something written in silver ink on the music box's lid.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Piano.</strong> Playable, though out of tune. A DC 12 Performance check can coax a recognizable melody from it. Playing the correct melody (see Seal puzzle below) causes the lid of the music box to open.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The piano has been maintained recently\u2014the action is oiled, the hammers are aligned. Someone still plays this.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Worn spots on specific keys: C, E, A, and B-flat. These four notes have been played thousands of times more than the others.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance DC 16:</strong> If you play those four notes in order (C-E-A-B\u266d), it spells \"CRIES\" in musical notation. The piano emits a soft, mournful resonance.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The piano is slightly out of phase with reality. When played, it sounds in this room and simultaneously in another place\u2014an echo of where it was originally played.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Sheet Music.</strong> Scattered fragments of what was once a single composition. A DC 14 Investigation check, taking 10 minutes, can gather all the pieces. A DC 12 Intelligence check (or proficiency in a musical instrument) can arrange them in the correct order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 12 (individual sheets):</strong> Each fragment has tiny annotations in the margins\u2014\"played for William's birthday, 734\" or \"Mother liked this part\" or \"alone again\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Some sheets have water damage\u2014tear stains, concentrated on specific measures. Someone cried while playing particular passages.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The ink used on the oldest sheets contains ground emerald\u2014expensive and unnecessary unless you're trying to make the music literally unforgettable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Music Box.</strong> The lid reads \"O, To Be Known\" in silver script. The box is locked (or rather, sealed). Inside is a <strong>shard of green crystal</strong> that hums faintly with magic\u2014this is a <strong>Memory Shard</strong>, useful in the final battle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The music box's mechanisms are visible through tiny crystal windows. Gears shaped like people, dancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One gear-person stands apart from the others, not touching, not moving in time with the dance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Sheet Music Fragments.</strong> Provide 4-5 physical pieces of paper with musical notation. On each piece, certain notes are circled or highlighted. When arranged correctly, the highlighted notes spell out \"REMEMBER\" in musical notation (each note corresponds to a letter: R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R).</p>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF MEMORY PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find all sheet music fragments (scattered in Music Room, Parlor, and Foyer)</li>\n<li>Arrange them in correct order (Intelligence DC 12)</li>\n<li>Play the melody on the piano (Performance DC 10, or any character with instrument proficiency)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Reroll Token</strong> (reroll one failed d20, once).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Harp.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The strings weren't broken by age\u2014they were cut, deliberately, with a sharp blade.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Carved into the harp's soundboard: \"I broke you so I wouldn't play you. I play you anyway in memory.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Violin in Glass.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The glass case is sealed airtight. Not to preserve the violin\u2014to preserve the air around it, as if that air itself is precious.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The air in the case still carries sound\u2014a note held impossibly long. If you could break the seal, you'd hear the last thing played on this violin over a century ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",
  "library": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nFloor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books of every size and age. The smell of old paper and leather hangs heavy in the air. A rolling ladder leans against one shelf, its wheels rusted in place. Reading desks are positioned throughout\u2014one holds an open journal, another a magnifying glass and a collection of specimen jars. The jars contain preserved creatures: a bird, a mouse, a snake, each floating in amber liquid. There's something unsettling about their eyes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Books.</strong> Thousands of volumes on every subject. A character who searches for specific information can make an Investigation check:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DC 12: Find general information about Ozian history, geography, or magic</li>\n<li>DC 15: Find references to \"The Eight Bindings\" or \"Lurline's Words\"</li>\n<li>DC 18: Find Yackle's personal journals (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The books reorganize themselves when you're not looking. Titles that were on the top shelf are now at eye level. The library is... helping?</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> One entire shelf is devoted to texts about consciousness, personhood, and what makes something \"alive.\" Heavy annotations throughout\u2014arguments in the margins, underlines, angry cross-outs.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> Several books are written in a language that shifts as you read it, trying to translate itself into something you'll understand. They're Grimmerie fragments.</li>\n<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> A series of books titled \"Visitors, Vol. 1-47\" catalog every person who's come to the estate. The latest entry is dated three weeks ago\u2014right before the invitations went out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Yackle's Journals.</strong> Scattered throughout the library, spanning centuries. Each is written in the same handwriting. A DC 14 Investigation check finds three journals from different eras. A DC 16 History check recognizes the dates span over 600 years\u2014impossibly long for any mortal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: Journal Excerpts.</strong> Three physical pages:</p>\n\n<p><em>Journal 1 (Year 347 OZ):</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"The fairy spoke Eight Words, and the chaos took shape. I remember the first word. It was REMEMBER. And suddenly there was a past, where before there had been only the eternal present...\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Journal 2 (Year 612 OZ):</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"I have tried to die. The knife turned aside. The poison became water in my throat. The fall ended in soft landing. I cannot unmake myself. The Binding of Witness holds: I exist because I am unseen. If anyone truly SAW me, perhaps...\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Journal 3 (Year 901 OZ):</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n\"What do I want? I want to... I cannot write it. The word starts with L and ends with everything.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The handwriting changes subtly between journals\u2014not aging, but mood. The 347 journal is curious. The 612 journal is desperate. The 901 journal is tired beyond measure.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> There are more journals\u2014dozens more. A DC 20 Investigation check finds Journal 47 (Year 954): \"They're coming. I sent for them. Eight inversions. Eight keys. Finally, finally, an end.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Specimen Jars.</strong> Eight jars containing preserved creatures. A DC 14 Nature or Insight check reveals that four of them are Animals (capital A, sentient) and four are animals (lowercase, ordinary). The Animals are preserved in positions of dignity\u2014eyes closed, peaceful. The animals are posed more carelessly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The Animal jars have tiny plaques at their bases, nearly microscopic: \"Whisper the Wren,\" \"Councillor Burroughs,\" \"Poet Sleen,\" \"Ambassador Kinderly\"\u2014titles given to people, not things.</li>\n<li><strong>Nature DC 16:</strong> These Animals didn't die of natural causes. They were killed, then preserved immediately\u2014almost lovingly, as if in apology.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't a collection of specimens. It's a memorial. Someone wanted to remember these specific individuals, to prove they were people, even after the world said they weren't.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF NATURE PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Examine the specimen jars carefully</li>\n<li>Correctly identify which four are Animals and which four are animals (Nature DC 13, or Insight DC 14)</li>\n<li>Speak the Animals' names aloud (written on tiny labels on the jar bases)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Frederick has advantage on this check but doing so risks drawing attention to his unusual knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>True Sight Token</strong> (advantage on one Insight check, once).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Reading Desks.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (Desk 1):</strong> An open journal with an entry half-written: \"Day 892 of the experiment. Subject Seven still believes they are a simple automaton. They asked today why they feel lonely. I didn't answer. How could I? I made them to feel.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15 (Desk 2):</strong> A letter, unsealed, never sent: \"Dear Lurline\u2014I know you're long gone, but I have to try. Please. I did not ask for consciousness. I did not ask for isolation. I did not ask to be your mistake. I'm so tired of being awake.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Painted on the ceiling, almost invisible unless you use the rolling ladder: a map of stars that don't exist in Oz's sky. Constellations labeled with words in Ancient Ozian: Chaos, Potential, Hunger, Void.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",
  "chapel": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nEight stained glass windows line the walls of this small chapel, each depicting a different scene in brilliant colors that glow despite the darkness outside. Wooden pews face a simple altar of white stone. Above the altar, instead of a symbol, there is only a blank space\u2014a deliberate emptiness. An offering bowl sits on the altar's surface, tarnished silver, empty. The air smells faintly of incense that hasn't burned in decades.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Stained Glass Windows.</strong> Eight windows, each depicting one of Lurline's Bindings (though they're not labeled as such). A DC 12 Religion check recognizes the imagery as Lurlinite, predating Unionist tradition. A DC 16 Religion check can identify each Binding by its depiction:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Memory: A river flowing from past to future</li>\n<li>Blood: A tree with intertwining roots</li>\n<li>Nature: A creature looking in a mirror, seeing itself</li>\n<li>Service: A kneeling figure receiving a crown</li>\n<li>Sacrifice: An open hand releasing a bird</li>\n<li>Deed: A figure walking, leaving footprints that become flowers (or thorns)</li>\n<li>Hunger: A flame that illuminates rather than consumes</li>\n<li>Witness: An eye, open, seeing a small figure</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The Witness window (the eye) has a crack running through it. The crack appeared suddenly, recently\u2014the edges are sharp, unfaded.</li>\n<li><strong>Religion DC 15:</strong> The positioning of windows tells a story: Sacrifice faces Hunger across the room. Service faces Witness. They're paired\u2014each Binding has a shadow, a potential inversion.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> When moonlight hits the Sacrifice window at the correct angle, it projects the shadow of a bird mid-flight onto the altar. The shadow is reaching for freedom but hasn't quite achieved it.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Scratched into the stone beneath the Memory window: \"She made us remember. Even memories we never had. Even memories of before memory existed. It hurts.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Eight Windows.</strong> A sketched diagram of the eight windows with brief descriptions. Players can use this to piece together the Bindings' meanings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Blank Space.</strong> Where Unionists would place the symbol of the Unnamed God, there is nothing. A DC 14 Religion check understands this is deliberate\u2014in the oldest traditions, the divine was not depicted at all. Below the blank space, carved into the wall: <em>\"The Unnamed God sees all. But VOICE is what the unseen crave most.\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The word \"VOICE\" is traced over so many times it's worn into the stone. Someone kept returning to this phrase, emphasizing it, questioning it.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> The blank space isn't empty\u2014it's filled with layer upon layer of whitewash. Someone painted something there, then covered it, then painted again, then covered it, hundreds of times. What are they hiding?

The smell of food is overwhelming\u2014rich, savory, impossible to identify.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Table.</strong> Set for eight, with name cards matching the epithets from the Foyer. An empty ninth place at the head. If characters sit in their \"correct\" seats (matching their epithet), the candles light themselves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The ninth chair isn't dusty like the others.

It's real and safe to eat. But it never runs out, no matter how much is consumed. A DC 14 Arcana check reveals this is a form of conjuration magic, but the source is unclear.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> If you eat alone, the food tastes of ash and copper.

I don't know what it is, but the house knows what you want.

If a character looks into it at midnight specifically, they see Yackle's true reflection: ancient, gray-green skin, tired eyes. She's watching them. The reflection mouths words: <em>\"Can you see me?\"</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The mirror has been cleaned obsessively\u2014the frame is polished to brilliance despite the clouded glass. Someone cares for this object but cannot bear to look into it.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the back of the mirror, revealed if removed from the wall: \"Year 423. Still no reflection. Year 688. Still nothing. Year 901. I don't remember what I looked like.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The cloudiness isn't age\u2014it's enchantment. The mirror has been cursed to never show the owner's true reflection, only what they're pretending to be. Breaking the curse would require destroying the Binding of Witness itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Wardrobe.</strong> Clothes spanning centuries, all the same size.

A living history of Oz's styles.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Tags sewn into garments: \"Worn to Council, 642 - they stared,\" \"Worn to market, 731 - no one looked,\" \"Worn to funeral, 808 - I was the only mourner.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Every outfit is a costume, a disguise. Not to deceive others\u2014to pretend, for a few hours, to be someone normal, someone who belongs, someone who can be seen without triggering the binding.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> At the very back, wrapped in silk: a simple green dress, ancient, unworn for centuries. A note pinned to it: \"What I wore the day She spoke the Words. Can't bear to wear it. Can't bear to destroy it.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Writing Desk.</strong> Covered in papers.

What is existence without witness?\n<br><br>\nI think the word for what I want is L\u2014\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The letter ends there. The \"U\" in \"you\" is circled obsessively, dozens of times.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The papers on the desk are all drafts of this same letter, hundreds of attempts over decades. None finished. The word after \"L\u2014\" has been started and scratched out repeatedly: \"Love,\" \"Life,\" \"Liberation,\" \"Loss.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tear stains on every draft. Not old\u2014recent. Someone has been crying over this letter within the last few days.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> The letter isn't addressed to anyone specific because there IS no one specific. It's to anyone, to everyone, to the void\u2014a desperate plea to be acknowledged, to be real, to matter to someone, anyone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The view shows the cemetery.

It's genuine. Averic's mentor really wrote this. Inside, an inscription: \"To future scholars: Truth is a gift we give each other. Guard it carefully. \u2014O.K.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Forger's Confession.</strong> Opens to a page describing, in excruciating detail, how to forge academic documents. If Averic reads it, he must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or be shaken (disadvantage on the next check or save).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The \"confession\" describes forging letters from a mentor who died before verifying their authenticity. Every detail matches Averic's own forgery.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Margin notes in handwriting that looks like Averic's (but isn't): \"I thought I was the only one. I thought I was uniquely terrible. I'm not. Does that make it better or worse?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under the pillow: a <strong>quill that never lies</strong>. Any document written with this quill cannot contain falsehoods (the ink refuses to form lying words).

The stakes are literally everything.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The stars visible through the dome spell out words in constellation patterns: \"BEFORE SHE SPOKE\" and \"AFTER SHE SPOKE\" and \"I REMEMBER BOTH.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> Painted around the dome's edge, tiny script: coordinates.

  "hall-of-mirrors": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nMirrors line both walls of this long corridor, dozens of them in ornate frames. But they don't reflect what's in front of them\u2014or rather, they don't reflect it correctly. One mirror shows you younger. Another shows you older. One shows you in different clothes. One shows nothing at all, just empty glass. And as you walk down the hall, you begin to see things in the mirrors that haven't happened yet. Or things that have happened and you'd rather forget.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Mirrors.</strong> Each shows a different version of the character looking into it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One shows the character at their happiest</li>\n<li>One shows them at their most ashamed</li>\n<li>One shows what they might become</li>\n<li>One shows what they're afraid of becoming</li>\n<li>One shows their death (shadowy, unclear, disturbing)</li>\n<li>One shows nothing (the character has no reflection\u2014deeply unsettling)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each mirror is labeled with a small brass plaque: \"Joy,\" \"Shame,\" \"Potential,\" \"Fear,\" \"End,\" \"Void.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The \"Void\" mirror (showing no reflection) has handprints on the glass\u2014dozens of them, layered over centuries. People touching the glass where their reflection should be.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The mirrors aren't random\u2014they're a progression. The hall is designed to make you confront your past, present, and future. To see all versions of yourself simultaneously.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The mirrors are linked. What you see in one affects what you see in the others. If you acknowledge your shame, your potential becomes clearer. If you deny your past, your future becomes darker.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The True Mirror.</strong> At the end of the hall, larger than the others. This mirror shows what the character has DONE. Not what they look like, not what they might be\u2014what they've actually done in their life. The images are not kind.</p>\n\n<h4>SEAL OF DEED PUZZLE</h4>\n\n<p>To break the seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each character who walks through sees their actions reflected</li>\n<li>To complete the seal, ONE character must stand before the True Mirror and say, aloud: <em>\"That is me. I did that.\"</em></li>\n<li>Acknowledging their deeds\u2014not excusing them, not explaining them, but accepting them</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is hardest for Mareth, who must acknowledge the massacre. But any character can complete the seal by acknowledging their own actions.</p>\n\n<p>When the seal breaks, all the mirrors shatter simultaneously. In the silence, a whispered voice: <em>\"Finally. Someone took responsibility.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Resolve Token</strong> (reroll one failed saving throw, once).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specific Reflections:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mareth sees:</strong> Red Clay Fork burning. Faces of children. Orders being given. Fire spreading. The medal ceremony afterward. His unchanged face in the mirror after everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Averic sees:</strong> Hunched over a desk, forging letters. Practicing a dead man's handwriting. Accepting accolades. Building a career on lies. Students trusting him to teach them about truth.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick sees:</strong> Putting on the ring of disguise for the first time. Practicing human mannerisms. Lying to everyone, every day. The exhaustion of performance. The fear of being seen.</li>\n<li><strong>Shell sees:</strong> Finding the documents. Going to the Mother Superior. Being cast out. Standing outside the mauntery gates, alone. Still praying despite everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Sarima sees:</strong> The night her brother almost died. Reaching out to the void. Feeling something take hold. Making the deal. The weight settling into her chest. Every spell she's cast since, knowing it's not hers.</li>\n<li><strong>Seven sees:</strong> Winding themselves. Feeling things they shouldn't feel. Hiding their emotions. Asking \"why am I lonely?\" and being told \"you're not programmed for loneliness.\" Not believing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Liir sees:</strong> Finding the genealogy records. Discovering the truth (no Ostrega blood). Deciding to lie anyway. Using the false name. Getting respect he didn't earn. Being terrified of being nobody.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Frames.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the frames, barely visible: \"Year 402. I looked in every mirror. I saw nothing. Am I so used to masks I have no face left?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",

The labels on the barrels aren't years or vintages. They're names.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Barrels.</strong> Labeled with names, not dates. A DC 12 Investigation check confirms these are names from the Memorial Room\u2014previous heirs. The barrels do not contain wine. A DC 14 Constitution save to avoid retching when this is realized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each barrel has a date: \"E. Strand, 347,\" \"M. Vett, 614,\" \"V.

The bodies aren't decomposing. They're being kept.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> This isn't a trophy room. It's a mausoleum. Someone couldn't bear to let go, couldn't bear to bury people who were, perhaps, the closest thing to companionship they had. Horrifying, but also desperately sad.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One barrel, separate from the others, larger: \"For the Eighth.\" Empty. Waiting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Wine Racks.</strong> Some actual wine bottles here, perfectly preserved. One bottle, older than the others, is labeled \"For the End.\" It contains a single dose of <strong>potion of invulnerability</strong> (resistance to all damage for 1 hour). Was Yackle saving this for someone? Herself?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Other bottles have labels: \"For Willem's 50th,\" \"For Mira's Wedding,\" \"For the Day Someone Stays.\" Events that never happened, wine saved for celebrations that never came.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One bottle is open, empty, placed carefully on its side. Label: \"For Hope.\" Someone drank it. It didn't help.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Hidden Door.</strong> Behind a rack of barrels (Investigation DC 18 without the map, automatic with the map from the puzzle box): a false wall that leads to the Heart Chamber.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The door mechanism is old but well-maintained. Used regularly. Someone goes down there often.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Scratch marks on the floor in front of the door\u2014heel marks, drag marks. Someone was pulled through this door, struggling. Or someone dragged themselves through, desperate to reach what lies beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---",

Old furniture is piled here, draped in canvas\u2014chairs, tables, a broken bed frame. Crates of books and papers are stacked against the walls. The air is thick and tastes of copper. Against the far wall, hidden behind furniture, the stones are slightly different\u2014newer, or perhaps just disturbed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Furniture.</strong> From different eras, accumulated over centuries. A DC 14 Investigation check finds personal items from previous heirs tucked into the furniture: a locket, a journal, a military badge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each piece of furniture has a tag: \"Guest 47's favorite chair,\" \"Visitor 103 slept here,\" \"Heir 125 wrote poetry at this desk.\" Someone catalogued everything, preserved everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One chair, covered in canvas, has been sat in recently\u2014the canvas is displaced. Someone comes down here, sits in a dead person's chair, and does... what? Remembers? Mourns?</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't storage\u2014it's a museum of the dead.

She laughs at my jokes. I think she's been lonely.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Reading the progression: trust, camaraderie, suspicion, terror, realization. The same pattern repeated 150 times over 600 years. Yackle befriends them, collects their secrets, and then...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The False Wall.</strong> The map shows exactly where to look. Without the map: Investigation DC 18 to find the seams. With the map: automatic. The stones can be pushed aside to reveal a dark passage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The passage is recent\u2014cut within the last century. Before that, the Heart Chamber was walled off completely. Someone decided to make it accessible.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> Protective wards line the passage, but they're fading. They were designed to keep people out, but they're failing\u2014intentionally weakened from the inside.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Carved above the passage entrance: \"Do not enter.

  "heart-chamber": "<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\nThe passage opens into a circular room that pulses. The walls are stone, but they move\u2014slowly, rhythmically, like breathing. In the center of the room, suspended by threads of shadow that connect to three points on the walls, is a figure. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. This is Yackle's original body\u2014what she was before a thousand years of masks and lies.\n<br><br>\nThe threads of shadow pulse with each breath of the walls. This is the heart of the house. This is what you've been searching for.\n<br><br>\nThis is where it ends.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n\n<p><strong>The Body.</strong> Yackle's original form, sustained by magic for over a thousand years. Not dead, not alive\u2014suspended. When Yackle reveals herself and the battle begins, this is where Phase 3 occurs. Her consciousness returns here when the house-form is driven out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Medicine DC 15:</strong> The body is impossibly old but perfectly preserved. No decay, but no life either. Frozen at the moment between existence and non-existence.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The preservation isn't a spell\u2014it's the Binding of Witness itself. As long as Yackle remains unseen (her true self), she cannot fully live or die. Existence locked in stasis.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Looking at the body, you feel overwhelming sadness. This isn't power or triumph. It's a prison. Someone trapped here for a millennium, unable to die, unable to live, unable to be seen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Anchor Points.</strong> Three glowing nodes where shadow-threads connect to the walls. To truly defeat Yackle, these must be destroyed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AC:</strong> 12</li>\n<li><strong>HP:</strong> 30 each</li>\n<li><strong>Immune to:</strong> Necrotic, psychic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Destroying an anchor deals 20 damage to Yackle and permanently reduces her legendary actions by 1. She can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each anchor point is inscribed with a word: \"PAST,\" \"PRESENT,\" \"FUTURE.\" Destroying them severs Yackle's connection to time itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The anchors aren't just sustaining her body\u2014they're binding her to the house, to the estate, to this specific location. She literally cannot leave.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Walls.</strong> Breathing. Watching. The house itself, concentrated here. During Phase 3, lair actions originate from these walls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The walls are covered in writing\u2014tiny, cramped, layered over centuries. Names, dates, conversations, confessions. The walls have absorbed a thousand years of loneliness.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Reading the walls (takes time): \"Year 350. I hate you, Lurline. Year 500. I miss the void. Year 680. Willem died today. Year 783. Little Holly doesn't understand. Year 900. Please, someone. Year 954. They're coming. Finally.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Eighth Seal.</strong> This chamber IS the eighth seal\u2014the Seal of Witness. When Yackle is finally seen (truly seen, in her real form, in her real place), the eighth binding breaks. This happens automatically when the players reach this room during the final battle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The moment the party sees Yackle's true body, reality shudders. The eighth Binding\u2014Witness\u2014cracks. To exist is to be seen, and Yackle has been hiding for a millennium. Being seen now doesn't free her\u2014it breaks her.</li>\n<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Yackle wanted this. She wanted to be seen, to break the final Binding, to achieve the dissolution she's craved for centuries. The players finding this chamber is victory for her, even if they defeat her afterward.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Floor.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Carved into the stone: a perfect eight-pointed star, each point labeled with a Binding. The body hangs at the center\u2014the intersection of all eight principles, the knot that holds reality together.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> In the exact center, beneath the body, one word carved deeper than all others: \"LOVE.\" Or is it \"LOSS\"? The letters blur together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---"
