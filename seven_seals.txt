<h1>The Seven Seals</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"To claim the inheritance, you must prove yourselves worthy. Unlock all seven seals before dawn, and the estate is yours."</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM NOTE:</strong> This page explains the Seven Seals system for "The Witch's Wake" adventure. Each seal represents one of the first seven Bindings and provides both immediate rewards and powerful abilities if all are completed before the final battle. The eighth seal is the Heart Chamber itself—when confronted, the Binding of Witness breaks.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Players will likely NOT complete all seven seals before Yackle reveals herself. The timeline expects 4-5 seals completed by the reveal. This creates tactical tension: rush to finish seals during the chase, or focus on survival?</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Seven Seals are magical puzzles scattered throughout Yackle's estate. Each seal corresponds to one of <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'The Eight Bindings'); return false;">Lurline's Eight Bindings</a> (specifically, the first seven—the eighth, Witness, is embodied by Yackle herself).</p>

<p>When the players arrive, <strong>Mr. Trism</strong> (the solicitor) reads Yackle's will, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>"The estate and its contents shall pass to those who prove themselves worthy. To demonstrate worthiness, the heirs must unlock all seven seals before dawn. The one who proves most worthy shall claim the greatest share."</em>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, of course, a lie. The seals aren't an inheritance test—they're a distraction and a way to weaken the Bindings. But the players don't know that yet.</p>

<h2>The Dual Purpose</h2>

<p><strong>What the Players Think:</strong> Breaking seals proves worthiness and unlocks inheritance.</p>

<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Each seal broken weakens the corresponding Binding, making it easier for Yackle to collect that character's secret and ultimately break the Binding entirely. However, breaking seals also grants the players powerful rewards—tools they'll desperately need in the final battle.</p>

<h2>How Seals Work</h2>

<h3>Breaking a Seal</h3>

<p>Each seal has a specific puzzle or challenge that must be solved. When a seal is broken:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Visual Effect:</strong> The room shimmers, magical energy releases, something clicks into place</li>
<li><strong>Immediate Reward:</strong> One character (usually the one who solved it, or the one most connected to that Binding) receives an Individual Reward</li>
<li><strong>Seal Mark:</strong> That character gains a glowing mark somewhere on their body (subtle, like a tattoo)—this tracks who has completed which seals</li>
<li><strong>Completion Tracking:</strong> The party is one step closer to the Seal Mastery bonus</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Two-Level Reward System</h3>

<p><strong>Individual Rewards (Immediate):</strong> Granted as soon as a seal is broken. Usable for the rest of the session.</p>

<p><strong>Seal Mastery (If All Seven Complete):</strong> If the party completes all seven seals before defeating Yackle, they gain powerful abilities specifically designed to counter her.</p>

<h2>Individual Rewards</h2>

<p>When a seal is broken, one character gains an immediate benefit:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Seal</th>
<th>Reward</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1. Memory</strong></td>
<td>Reroll Token</td>
<td>Reroll one failed d20 roll (attack, save, or check). Use before the result is determined. Once per session.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2. Blood</strong></td>
<td>Death's Denial</td>
<td>The first time you drop to 0 HP, you automatically stabilize at 0 HP (don't make death saves). You're unconscious but won't die from failed saves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3. Nature</strong></td>
<td>True Sight Token</td>
<td>Gain advantage on one Insight check of your choice. This check automatically sees through lies and illusions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>4. Service</strong></td>
<td>Swift Aid</td>
<td>For the rest of the session, you can use the Help action as a bonus action instead of an action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>5. Sacrifice</strong></td>
<td>Last Strike</td>
<td>When you drop to 0 HP, you can immediately make one weapon attack or cast one cantrip as a reaction before falling unconscious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>6. Deed</strong></td>
<td>Resolve Token</td>
<td>Reroll one failed saving throw. Use after you see the result. Once per session.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>7. Hunger</strong></td>
<td>Second Wind</td>
<td>As a bonus action, you can recover one spent Hit Die and immediately roll it, regaining that many HP + your Constitution modifier.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> Let the players decide who gets each reward, or if they can't decide, award it to the character whose secret most closely aligns with that Binding (e.g., Averic gets Memory, Liir gets Blood, etc.).</p>

<h2>Seal Mastery Abilities</h2>

<p>If the party completes all seven seals before the final battle with Yackle begins, they unlock <strong>Seal Mastery</strong>—powerful abilities specifically designed to counter Yackle's mechanics.</p>

<p><strong>CRITICAL BONUS:</strong> If all seven seals are completed before engaging Yackle in Phase 1, she starts combat at <strong>half HP</strong> (100 instead of 200).</p>

<h3>Individual Seal Mastery Powers</h3>

<p>Each completed seal grants a specific anti-Yackle ability to whoever received the Individual Reward from that seal:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Seal</th>
<th>Mastery Ability</th>
<th>Effect vs. Yackle</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Memory</strong></td>
<td>Truth of the Past</td>
<td>Once per battle, you can force Yackle to reroll one attack roll or ability check and take the lower result.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Blood</strong></td>
<td>Severed Lineage</td>
<td>Yackle's necrotic damage against you is reduced by half (round down).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Nature</strong></td>
<td>True Form</td>
<td>Yackle cannot use illusion magic or change her appearance while you can see her. She must remain in her true form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Service</strong></td>
<td>Broken Oath</td>
<td>Any creature dominated or charmed by Yackle can repeat their saving throw at the start of each of their turns (instead of only when damaged).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sacrifice</strong></td>
<td>Gift Freely Given</td>
<td>When you cast a healing spell on an ally within 30 feet, they heal an additional 1d6 HP.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Deed</strong></td>
<td>Weight of Action</td>
<td>Yackle has disadvantage on the first attack roll she makes each round.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Hunger</strong></td>
<td>Denied Consumption</td>
<td>Yackle cannot use legendary actions during the first round of each combat phase.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>Seal Mastery makes the final battle significantly more survivable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half HP</strong> means Phase 1 is much shorter</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong> on her first attack each round reduces incoming damage</li>
<li><strong>No legendary actions</strong> in round 1 gives players setup time</li>
<li><strong>True Form</strong> prevents her from using illusions to confuse the party</li>
<li><strong>Broken Oath</strong> lets dominated allies break free faster</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced healing</strong> from Sacrifice keeps the party alive longer</li>
<li><strong>Forced rerolls</strong> from Memory can prevent devastating crits</li>
<li><strong>Reduced necrotic damage</strong> from Blood keeps the tank alive</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge: completing all seven seals before Yackle reveals herself (end of Hour 3) is difficult. Players must balance exploration, puzzle-solving, and social interaction.</p>

<h2>Seal Details</h2>

<h3>Seal 1: Memory (Music Room)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> The past is real and shapes the present.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Reconstruct a fragmented musical composition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sheet music fragments are scattered across the Music Room, Parlor, and Foyer</li>
<li>Players must gather all pieces (Investigation DC 14, 10 minutes)</li>
<li>Arrange them in correct order (Intelligence DC 12 or proficiency in musical instrument)</li>
<li>Play the melody on the grand piano (Performance DC 10, or automatic with instrument proficiency)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Handout:</strong> Provide 4-5 physical sheet music fragments. Highlighted notes spell "REMEMBER" when arranged correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The music box opens, revealing a Memory Shard (glowing green crystal, useful in final battle). One character gains the <strong>Reroll Token</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Reconstructing the past from fragments—literally putting memory back together.</p>

<h3>Seal 2: Blood (Portrait Gallery)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Lineage connects beings across time; ancestry is fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Complete the Ostrega family tree.</p>

<ul>
<li>The gallery contains portraits of the Ostrega family spanning centuries</li>
<li>A large family tree diagram has several names missing</li>
<li>Portraits have plaques with names and dates—players must match them to fill the gaps</li>
<li>Investigation DC 12 to find all relevant portraits</li>
<li>Intelligence DC 10 to correctly place names in the tree</li>
<li><strong>Complication:</strong> One name (Yackle's original mortal name: "Yael Ostrega") appears impossibly early and impossibly late in the tree—she's both an ancestor and a descendant</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Handout:</strong> Physical family tree with blank spaces. Players can write names in as they discover them.</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The central portrait frame opens, revealing a hidden chamber containing a <strong>Blood Phylactery</strong> (a locked containing Ostrega bloodline magic). One character gains <strong>Death's Denial</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Lineage and ancestry—but with the twist that Yackle appears in impossible places, hinting that bloodlines can be manipulated.</p>

<h3>Seal 3: Nature (Library)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> All beings are their kind; nothing can be other than what it is.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> A magical mirror reveals true nature.</p>

<ul>
<li>The library contains a large standing mirror covered by a cloth</li>
<li>When uncovered, the mirror shows each character's "true self"—not their disguise or performance, but what they actually are</li>
<li>Frederick (the Fox Animal) sees his true fox form</li>
<li>Other characters see symbolic representations of their secrets</li>
<li>To break the seal, one character must look into the mirror and <strong>accept what they see</strong>—speak aloud an acknowledgment of their true nature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Handout:</strong> Descriptive cards for what each character sees in the mirror (given privately to each player).</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The mirror shatters, reforming into a <strong>Shard of Truth</strong> (can be used to see through illusions). One character gains <strong>True Sight Token</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Confronting who you really are beneath the masks and performances.</p>

<p><strong>Danger:</strong> If Frederick looks in the mirror, his disguise might flicker—other characters might see his true fox form reflected.</p>

<h3>Seal 4: Service (Servant Quarters → Memorial Room)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Duty creates meaning through bonds; power without obligation is chaos.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> A two-part challenge about service and remembrance.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1 - Servant Quarters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bell-pull hangs in the servant quarters, labeled "Ring for Service"</li>
<li>When pulled, a spectral servant (ghost of someone who died serving Yackle) appears</li>
<li>The ghost asks, "How may I serve?" with genuine eagerness despite being dead</li>
<li>The correct response is NOT to give an order, but to ask: <strong>"How may I serve YOU?"</strong></li>
<li>This reversal of the expected power dynamic is key</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part 2 - Memorial Room:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ghost leads players to a hidden Memorial Room where dozens of servants who died in Yackle's service are commemorated</li>
<li>Many died serving her willingly, others were trapped, all are forgotten</li>
<li>To complete the seal, players must honor the dead—speak their names aloud (reading from plaques), offer a moment of silence, or perform a small ritual of remembrance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Handout:</strong> "Names of the Lost" - a list of servants with brief descriptions of how they died in service.</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The ghost thanks them and fades peacefully. The room fills with warm light. One character gains <strong>Swift Aid</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> True service is reciprocal—it creates bonds and obligations both ways. Those served owe care to those who serve.</p>

<h3>Seal 5: Sacrifice (Chapel)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Giving freely creates value; you cannot gain without loss.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Give something precious without expectation of return.</p>

<ul>
<li>The chapel contains an altar with a collection basin</li>
<li>An inscription reads: "True sacrifice is given freely, expecting nothing"</li>
<li>Players must place something of genuine personal value in the basin—not just gold, but something that matters</li>
<li>The item must be given willingly, without knowing if they'll get it back</li>
<li>Examples: Liir's false signet ring, Averic's forged letters, Shell's holy symbol, Frederick's disguise ring</li>
<li>GM's call on what counts as "genuine sacrifice"—it should hurt to give it up</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The item disappears into golden light. A moment later, it returns transformed—enhanced with magical properties that reflect the sacrifice. One character gains <strong>Last Strike</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Success:</strong> The item stays gone, but the seal breaks anyway. Sometimes sacrifice doesn't return what was given—that's the point.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> True giving means risking loss. Sacrifice isn't transactional.</p>

<p><strong>Connection:</strong> This directly challenges Sarima's transactional magic—can she give without demanding return?</p>

<h3>Seal 6: Deed (Hall of Mirrors)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Actions shape the actor; what you do becomes what you are.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Confront what you've done and acknowledge it.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Hall of Mirrors shows each character reflections of their significant deeds—both good and bad</li>
<li>Mareth sees Red Clay Fork—the burning village, the faces of those he ordered killed</li>
<li>Other characters see their own pivotal moments: Averic forging letters, Shell exposing the mauntery, etc.</li>
<li>To break the seal, one character must stand before their reflection and <strong>speak aloud what they did</strong>—not justification, not excuse, just acknowledgment</li>
<li>"I ordered the massacre of Red Clay Fork. I killed 143 people."</li>
<li>"I forged my mentor's letters. I built my career on lies."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The mirrors shatter. The weight of deed doesn't disappear, but it's <strong>acknowledged</strong>—no longer hidden. One character gains <strong>Resolve Token</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Deeds do shape you, but denying them doesn't unmake them. Acknowledgment is the first step toward transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Danger:</strong> This room can trigger confessions, emotional breakdowns, or party conflict if characters judge each other harshly.</p>

<h3>Seal 7: Hunger (Dining Room)</h3>

<p><strong>Binding:</strong> Desire drives becoming, not consumption; want must create, not devour.</p>

<p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Choose what you truly want, not what you think you should want.</p>

<ul>
<li>A feast appears on the dining table—food, drink, and at each place setting, a small box</li>
<li>Each box contains something the character wants: wealth, power, knowledge, freedom, redemption, etc.</li>
<li>The boxes are labeled with names, but not the obvious ones—they're labeled with what each character secretly hungers for</li>
<li>Seven's box: "To Be Real"</li>
<li>Frederick's box: "To Stop Hiding"</li>
<li>Shell's box: "To Know Why"</li>
<li>To break the seal, characters must choose to open their box and <strong>admit they want what's inside</strong>—not need, not deserve, but <em>want</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> The boxes open. Inside: nothing tangible, but a profound sense of clarity about their own desires. One character gains <strong>Second Wind</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> The boxes contain symbolic items (a key, a mirror, a letter) that represent the path toward what they hunger for.</p>

<p><strong>Theme:</strong> Acknowledging desire is not weakness. Hunger drives growth. Wanting is not the same as consuming.</p>

<p><strong>THE REVEAL:</strong> This is often when Yackle reveals herself. The Dining Room is her domain, and when the party shows their hungers openly, she appears: <em>"How wonderful. You've made this so much easier."</em></p>

<h2>Timing and Pacing</h2>

<h3>Expected Progression</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hour 1 (Arrival):</strong> 1-2 seals (Memory and/or Blood)</li>
<li><strong>Hour 2 (Exploration):</strong> 2-3 more seals (Nature, Service, maybe Sacrifice)</li>
<li><strong>Hour 3 (Escalation):</strong> 1-2 more seals (Deed, possibly Hunger)</li>
<li><strong>THE REVEAL:</strong> Yackle shows herself, usually during or right after Seal 7</li>
<li><strong>Hour 4 (Battle):</strong> Fighting Yackle, possibly completing remaining seals during the chase</li>
</ul>

<h3>If Players Are Slow</h3>

<p>Some groups get distracted by roleplay, investigation, or caution. If they've only completed 2-3 seals by Hour 3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yackle can still reveal herself (she's impatient)</li>
<li>During Phase 2 (the chase), players can complete remaining seals while fleeing</li>
<li>Some seals might be skipped entirely—that's okay, it makes the final battle harder but still winnable</li>
</ul>

<h3>If Players Rush</h3>

<p>If players focus entirely on seals and complete 5-6 before Hour 3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reward their efficiency—they're setting themselves up for success</li>
<li>Yackle might reveal herself early to prevent them from finishing all seven</li>
<li>The final battle will be easier, which is their reward for smart play</li>
</ul>

<h2>GM Tips</h2>

<h3>Rewarding Clever Solutions</h3>

<p>If players solve a seal in an unexpected but thematically appropriate way, reward it. The seals aren't about strict mechanics—they're about engaging with the themes of the Bindings.</p>

<h3>Failed Seal Attempts</h3>

<p>If players completely misunderstand a seal puzzle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give hints through environmental details</li>
<li>Have Mr. Trism or Madame Viridian (Yackle in disguise) offer cryptic guidance</li>
<li>Allow Intelligence/Wisdom checks to gain insight</li>
<li>Let them try multiple approaches—seals don't "lock out" after failed attempts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracking Completion</h3>

<p>Keep a visible tracker for the players—they should know how many seals they've completed and how many remain. This creates urgency and helps them make tactical decisions.</p>

<h3>The Eighth Seal</h3>

<p>Players will notice there are only seven seals but eight Bindings. If they ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Trism says the will only mentions seven</li>
<li>Clever players might deduce that the eighth (Witness) is different</li>
<li>The truth: the eighth seal is Yackle herself—when they confront her true form, that Binding breaks</li>
</ul>

<h2>After the Seals</h2>

<p>Once seals are broken, they stay broken—the benefits persist for the rest of the session. Players should feel increasingly powerful as they complete more seals, building confidence for the final confrontation.</p>

<p>But remember: each broken seal also weakens the corresponding Binding, making it easier for Yackle to extract that character's secret. The tools they're gaining to fight her are also the tools she needs to unmake reality.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that the players are helping her even as they prepare to stop her.</p>
