## Design Principles

### Balance
- All classes follow 5e D&D power curves
- Spellcasters use standard spell slot progression
- Martial classes have comparable damage output
- Support classes provide meaningful team benefits

### Oz Integration
- Each class reflects Oz's political situation
- Religious classes (Unionist/Lurlinite) are oppressor/oppressed
- Many classes have explicit resistance/state loyalist flavors
- Animal rights and persecution themes woven throughout
- Green Elixir, Tiktoks, Grimmerie, and other lore elements referenced

### Subclass Variety
- Most classes have 2-3 subclasses
- Subclasses offer meaningful mechanical and narrative choices
- Some subclasses unique to Oz (Circle of Liberation, Inquisition Domain)

### Hyperlinks
- Extensive inline hyperlinks to other wiki pages
- All links use onclick format: `onclick="Tabs.openTab('page-id', 'Page Title'); return false;"`
- Forward references tracked in CONTENT_TRACKER.md
