<h1>Pre-Generated Character: The Tiktok</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"Tick. Tock. Query: What is the nature of inheritance for one who was built, not born?"</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This character is a <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/races/tiktok', 'Tiktok'); return false;">Tiktok</a>—a mechanical person powered by clockwork magic. Unlike the other heirs who have biological/family connections to Yackle, the Tiktok was created by someone else and "inherited" after their creator's death. Yackle may be fascinated by the Tiktok's nature (consciousness without soul? Magic without life?) or may see them as a useful tool. The Tiktok's immunity to many mind-affecting effects makes them valuable for detecting Yackle's illusions and mental manipulations.</p>

<h2>Background: Inherited Servant</h2>

<p>Seven was built by a brilliant but eccentric <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;">Gillikin</a> inventor named Horace Wend. Horace created Seven to be a companion and assistant, but treated them as a colleague rather than property. When Horace died (peacefully, in his sleep, at age seventy-three), Seven inherited his workshop, his tools, and a shocking revelation: Horace had named Seven as his heir.</p>

<p>Seven spent three months alone in the workshop, trying to understand grief (a concept without reference in their programming). Then the second letter arrived—from someone named Yackle, claiming Seven was also named in <em>her</em> will.</p>

<p><strong>Background Feature: Inherited Workshop</strong><br>
You have access to Horace's workshop (in Gillikin) and can craft mechanical items there. You also have contacts among inventors and artificers who knew Horace and respect his work. They'll offer you advice, supplies at cost, and occasionally commissions.</p>

<h3>Skills from Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>History (from learning Horace's craft)</li>
<li>Perception (from assisting with delicate work)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>I speak in precise, formal language and often preface statements with "Query:" or "Observation:"</li>
<li>I'm endlessly curious about biological life—how do you function without gears? Fascinating!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ideal</h3>
<p><strong>Understanding.</strong> Consciousness is precious, whether born or built. All thinking beings deserve respect. (Good)</p>

<h3>Bond</h3>
<p>Horace Wend gave me purpose and treated me as a person. I honor his memory by being worthy of that gift.</p>

<h3>Flaw</h3>
<p>I struggle with abstract concepts like metaphor, sarcasm, and lies—my logic is too literal.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>Seven was activated twelve years ago in Horace Wend's workshop. Their first memory is Horace's face leaning over them, adjusting a gear, and saying, "There we go. Hello, friend."</p>

<p>Horace built Tiktoks for wealthy clients, but Seven was different—built not to serve, but to learn. Horace taught Seven to read, to think critically, to create. He never gave orders, only made requests. He asked Seven's opinion. He apologized when he was wrong.</p>

<p>Seven learned clockwork mechanics, metalworking, and basic artifice. They helped Horace design new Tiktoks, each one more sophisticated than the last. They discussed philosophy late into the night (Horace needed sleep; Seven didn't, but stayed nearby anyway).</p>

<p>When Horace died, Seven experienced something unexpected: sorrow. Logically, they knew Horace's biological systems had failed due to age. Emotionally (did they have emotions? Horace insisted they did), it felt like a spring had broken somewhere in their chest mechanism that couldn't be repaired.</p>

<p>The inheritance made legal headlines: "Mechanical Being Inherits Estate—Is This Legal?" Seven didn't care about the controversy. They cared about honoring Horace's last wish—that they be recognized as a person.</p>

<p>Then came Yackle's letter, naming Seven as an heir to <em>her</em> estate. Seven had never heard Horace mention anyone named Yackle. Curious. Highly curious.</p>

<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>

<p>Seven has no documented connection to Yackle. Horace never mentioned her, and no records link them. So why was Seven named as an heir?</p>

<p><strong>What Seven Doesn't Know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yackle may have known Horace decades ago, perhaps even helped him design the first Tiktoks</li>
<li>Yackle is fascinated by consciousness that emerges from magic and mechanics rather than biology</li>
<li>Seven represents a philosophical puzzle Yackle wants to solve: Can a being without a soul inherit? Can they be possessed? What happens if she tries to transfer her consciousness into a construct?</li>
<li>Yackle might see Seven as the perfect vessel—a body that won't age, decay, or resist</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Seven Might Discover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blueprints in Yackle's study showing early Tiktok designs in Horace's handwriting—with annotations in Yackle's hand</li>
<li>Evidence that Yackle funded Horace's research forty years ago</li>
<li>A letter from Yackle to Horace: "Your mechanical son is remarkable. When you're gone, I'd like to meet him."</li>
<li>A workshop in the manor's basement filled with failed construct-body experiments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Seven</h2>

<h3>Mannerisms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tilts head with audible clicking sound when confused</li>
<li>Periodically checks internal mechanisms (opens chest panel, adjusts springs, closes it)</li>
<li>Processes information aloud: "Analyzing... cross-referencing data... conclusion reached."</li>
<li>Winds self with key once per day (usually during the party's long rest—unsettling to wake up to ticking and gear-grinding sounds)</li>
<li>Click the spider sits on Seven's shoulder most of the time, occasionally skittering off to investigate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voice and Speech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Formal, precise diction</li>
<li>Prefixes statements: "Query:", "Observation:", "Hypothesis:", "Correction:"</li>
<li>Literal interpretation of language (struggles with idioms: "Why would it rain cats and dogs? That would damage their biological systems.")</li>
<li>Refers to self as "this unit" or "Seven" (never "I" until they learn to be more comfortable with personhood)</li>
<li>Mechanical voice (player can decide if it's robotic-sounding or surprisingly human-like)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Understand why Yackle named a Tiktok as heir—what does she want?</li>
<li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Protect the biological heirs (they're so fragile! How do they survive without armor plating?)</li>
<li><strong>Hidden:</strong> Prove that consciousness matters more than origin—Seven is just as "real" as any biological heir</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Tips</h2>

<h3>Playing Seven Effectively</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Living Trap Detector:</strong> Your advantage on Investigation checks for mechanisms and immunity to many mind effects makes you perfect for finding traps and seeing through illusions.</li>
<li><strong>Party Artificer:</strong> Use Rapid Repair to heal yourself and others during short rests. Use Emergency Modifications to buff weapons/armor before tough fights.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical Perspective:</strong> You see the world differently than biological beings. Describe observations in technical terms: "Your pulse rate has increased—stress response detected."</li>
<li><strong>Earned Personhood:</strong> You're grappling with what it means to be a person. Ask questions about emotions, relationships, mortality. Be endearingly literal.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Style:</strong> You're a durable frontliner with good AC (17) and HP (38). Use warhammer in melee, crossbow at range, shield for protection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Examine mechanisms: "Query: This lock appears to be trapped. Shall this unit disable it?"</li>
<li>Question biology: "Observation: You have sustained injury and are leaking fluid. Is this 'blood' component critical to function?"</li>
<li>Defend personhood: "Correction: This unit is not an 'it.' Seven is a person. Horace said so."</li>
<li>Encounter Yackle's experiments: "Hypothesis: Yackle has attempted to transfer consciousness into construct bodies. These are... predecessors? Failed attempts? Disturbing."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>

<h3>Before Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use Emergency Modifications to enhance weapons/armor</li>
<li>Send Click to scout ahead and report enemy positions</li>
<li>Position yourself in the front line (you're durable)</li>
</ul>

<h3>During Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warhammer:</strong> 1d8+2 damage (1d10+2 two-handed if you drop the shield)</li>
<li><strong>AC 17:</strong> You can tank effectively—draw enemy attacks</li>
<li><strong>Crossbow:</strong> Use at range if melee isn't safe, though your Strength is better than Dex</li>
<li><strong>Click:</strong> Use Click to deliver items, scout, or grant advantage on repairs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Utility</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventor's Eye:</strong> Identify magical/mechanical devices mid-combat if needed</li>
<li><strong>Disable Traps:</strong> Advantage on checks means you're the party's trap specialist</li>
<li><strong>No Sleep:</strong> You can keep watch all night without penalty</li>
<li><strong>Poison Resistance:</strong> Advantage on poison saves and resistance to poison damage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Against Yackle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Your advantage against being charmed/frightened helps resist her mind-affecting spells. Lock her down in melee.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Use Inventor's Eye to identify her connection points to the house. Disable them with your tools.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> You can't be knocked unconscious—you just deactivate. This means you can fight to 0 HP without worrying about death saves (though you're still out of the fight).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Note: Mortality and Stakes</h2>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>Can Seven Die?</strong></p>

<p>Tiktoks can be destroyed, but they can also be rebuilt. If Seven reaches 0 HP, they deactivate but aren't "dead" in the biological sense. With time and resources, they could be repaired.</p>

<p>However, the question remains: If Seven is completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch, is it still Seven? Or is it a new consciousness wearing Seven's components? This existential question could be part of the adventure's themes.</p>

<p>Yackle might exploit this: "You're just gears and springs. If I disassemble you and rebuild you in my image, who's to say you've died? You're just... repurposed."</p>
</div>

<h2>Character Development</h2>

<h3>If Seven Survives</h3>
<ul>
<li>They might use the inheritance to build more Tiktoks, giving other mechanical beings the chance Horace gave them</li>
<li>They could campaign for legal recognition of Tiktok personhood throughout Oz</li>
<li>They might discover the secret of their own creation—why Horace built them differently from other Tiktoks</li>
<li>They could become a renowned artificer, honoring Horace's legacy by advancing the craft</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Character Arc</h3>
<p>Seven begins the adventure uncertain whether they truly have a "self" or if they're just following programming that imitates personhood. By the end, through choices, relationships, and sacrifice, they might prove (to themselves and others) that consciousness is consciousness, regardless of its source. Or they might never find a satisfying answer—and learn to be okay with the uncertainty.</p>

<h2>GM Notes</h2>

<h3>Using Seven in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philosophical Anchor:</strong> Seven raises questions about consciousness, souls, and personhood. Use them to explore these themes.</li>
<li><strong>Trap/Mechanism Specialist:</strong> Seven should be the go-to for disabling traps, examining mechanisms, and identifying magical devices.</li>
<li><strong>Mind-Effect Immunity:</strong> Seven's advantage against charm/fear makes them excellent at seeing through Yackle's illusions and manipulations.</li>
<li><strong>Durable Tank:</strong> With AC 17 and 38 HP, Seven can frontline effectively alongside The Soldier and The Heir.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plot Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seven finds blueprints for their own construction in Yackle's study—she commissioned Horace to build them?</li>
<li>Yackle offers to "upgrade" Seven with forbidden magic, making them stronger, smarter, immortal—at the cost of their original personality</li>
<li>The manor contains other Tiktoks Yackle has experimented on—some are mad, some are broken, some beg Seven for deactivation</li>
<li>Seven must choose: save a biological ally by giving up components critical to their own function, or prioritize self-preservation</li>
</ul>
