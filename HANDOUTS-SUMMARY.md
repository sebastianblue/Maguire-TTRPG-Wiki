## 🎲 Dashboard Integration

### Handouts Panel in GM Dashboard

The dashboard already has a "Handouts" panel. Here's what goes where:

| Dashboard Room | Handout Files | Mark as "hasHandout: true" |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Approach | - | No |
| Cemetery | 04-cemetery-epitaphs | ✅ Yes |
| Foyer | 01-the-will | ✅ Yes |
| Music Room | 05-sheet-music | No (seal location) |
| Library | - | ✅ Yes (books for Seal 3) |

| Master Bedroom | - | ✅ Yes (cabinet loot) |
| Yackle's Study | 03, 07, 08, 10 | No (cabinets tracked separately) |

**Note:** The dashboard's handout counter shows "0/12" — this refers to the 12 handout files players can find during exploration. Reward cards from seals/cabinets are tracked separately in the Seals/Cabinet panels.
