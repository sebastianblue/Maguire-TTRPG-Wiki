<h1>House Horrors</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"The house is not haunted. The house IS the haunt."</p>

<p>House Horrors are animated manifestations of <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\'s Estate'); return false;">Yackle's manor</a>, brought to life through her dark magic. Furniture attacks, portraits watch, shadows move with malicious intent, and the house itself hungers. These creatures serve as minions during combat encounters and as atmospheric hazards throughout <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/index', 'The Witch\'s Wake'); return false;">The Witch's Wake</a> adventure.</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> House Horrors become more active and dangerous as the adventure progresses. Early encounters might feature one or two horrors as environmental threats. By the final confrontation with Yackle (especially Phase 2 when she merges with the house), multiple House Horrors attack simultaneously while lair actions trigger.</p>

<p><strong>Scaling Difficulty:</strong> Use fewer, weaker horrors for smaller or lower-level parties. Combine multiple horrors for climactic battles. All House Horrors are vulnerable when Yackle is defeated—they collapse into ordinary objects once her magic is broken.</p>
</div>

<h2>General House Horror Traits</h2>

<p>All House Horrors share certain characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bound to the Manor:</strong> House Horrors cannot leave Yackle's estate. If forced outside, they become inanimate objects.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While motionless, they are indistinguishable from normal objects. DC varies by creature.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> When Yackle is reduced to 0 HP in Phase 3, all House Horrors immediately collapse into mundane objects and can be destroyed easily.</li>
<li><strong>No Self-Preservation:</strong> House Horrors fight to the death and never flee or negotiate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Animated Furniture</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"The chair moved. I swear the chair moved!"</p>

<p>Chairs slam themselves into victims, tables flip and crush, wardrobes trap people inside. The most common House Horrors, animated furniture serves as both ambush predators and loyal minions.</p>

<p><strong>Antimagic Susceptibility.</strong> The furniture is incapacitated while in the area of an <em>antimagic field</em>. If targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become inanimate for 1 minute.</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While motionless, the furniture is indistinguishable from a normal piece of furniture.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Slam.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong>Charge (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The furniture moves up to its speed in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Large. Each creature in the line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage on a failed save and being knocked prone, or half damage on a success.</p>

<h2>Malevolent Portrait</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"The eyes in the painting... they followed me down the hall."</p>

<p>The portraits in <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\'s Estate'); return false;">Yackle's gallery</a> are more than paintings—they're watchers, spies, and sometimes attackers. Spectral forms emerge from the frames to defend their mistress.</p>

<h3>Malevolent Portrait</h3>
<p><em>Medium construct, neutral evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 22 (4d8 + 4)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 0 ft., fly 30 ft. (hover, when manifested)</p>

<table>
<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>
<tr><td>6 (-2)</td><td>16 (+3)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>8 (-1)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Damage Resistances</strong> acid, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks<br>
<strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> understands Common but can't speak<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Incorporeal Movement.</strong> When manifested, the portrait can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While in its frame and not manifested, the portrait is indistinguishable from a normal painting. It can still see and hear through the painting.</p>

<p><strong>Bound to Frame.</strong> The portrait cannot move more than 60 feet from its frame. If the frame is destroyed (AC 12, 10 HP), the manifested form immediately dissipates.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Manifest.</strong> The portrait causes a spectral image of the painting's subject to emerge from the frame. This form is incorporeal and can hover. While manifested, the portrait can make attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Spectral Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage.</p>

<p><strong>Horrifying Visage (Recharge 5-6).</strong> Each creature within 30 feet of the manifested portrait that can see it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<h4>Reactions</h4>

<p><strong>Return to Frame.</strong> When the manifested form would take damage, it can use its reaction to instantly return to its frame, negating the damage. It can manifest again on its next turn.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>Portraits manifest, use Horrifying Visage to frighten the party, attack with Spectral Touch, then return to frames when damaged. Destroying the frame is more effective than fighting the manifestation. Multiple portraits in the gallery can coordinate attacks—one manifests to attack while others remain hidden, then they rotate.</p>

<h2>Creeping Shadow</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"It wasn't my shadow. Shadows don't have teeth."</p>

<p>The shadows in Yackle's manor move independently, detaching from their sources to stalk, strangle, and consume. They creep along walls and floors, always watching.</p>

<h3>Creeping Shadow</h3>
<p><em>Medium undead, chaotic evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 12<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 16 (3d8 + 3)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>
<tr><td>6 (-2)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>6 (-2)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>8 (-1)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Skills</strong> Stealth +4<br>
<strong>Damage Vulnerabilities</strong> radiant<br>
<strong>Damage Resistances</strong> acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks<br>
<strong>Damage Immunities</strong> necrotic, poison<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> —<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 1/2 (100 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Amorphous.</strong> The shadow can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Stealth.</strong> While in dim light or darkness, the shadow can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight Weakness.</strong> While in sunlight, the shadow has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Strength Drain.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>Shadows attack from hiding in dim light, targeting isolated or weakened party members. They drain Strength to weaken martial characters, making them easier prey. Multiple shadows can gang up on one target. They flee from bright light sources and avoid radiant damage at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Use:</strong> Shadows are perfect for creating paranoia. Have them follow the party without attacking initially—just shadows that move wrong, flicker strangely, or appear where they shouldn't. When combat starts, they strike from unexpected angles.</p>

<h2>Strangling Carpet</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"The rug beneath our feet wasn't a rug anymore. It was a snake."</p>

<p>The manor's carpets and tapestries can animate to wrap around victims, constricting and suffocating. They blend perfectly with normal floor coverings until it's too late.</p>

<h3>Strangling Carpet</h3>
<p><em>Large construct, unaligned</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 12<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 45 (6d10 + 12)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 15 ft., climb 15 ft.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>
<tr><td>17 (+3)</td><td>15 (+2)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>1 (-5)</td><td>3 (-4)</td><td>1 (-5)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 6<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> —<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Antimagic Susceptibility.</strong> The carpet is incapacitated while in the area of an <em>antimagic field</em>. If targeted by <em>dispel magic</em>, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute.</p>

<p><strong>Damage Transfer.</strong> While grappling a creature, the carpet takes only half damage from attacks, and the grappled creature takes the other half.</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While motionless, the carpet is indistinguishable from a normal carpet or tapestry.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Constrict.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the carpet can't constrict another target.</p>

<p><strong>Smother.</strong> The carpet wraps itself around a grappled target's head. The target begins suffocating and cannot breathe, speak, or cast spells with verbal components. At the start of each of the target's turns while smothered, they take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>Carpets wait until a creature stands on them, then attack with surprise (advantage on initiative). They constrict one target and immediately smother them, focusing on casters who need verbal components. Allies attacking the carpet risk hurting the grappled victim (Damage Transfer). The victim must escape the grapple (DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics) to free themselves.</p>

<p><strong>CR Note:</strong> This is a CR 2 creature, but it can instantly incapacitate a caster and start dealing consistent damage. Use sparingly or in combination with other threats.</p>

<h2>Living Chandelier</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"The chandelier didn't fall. It attacked."</p>

<p>The massive crystal chandeliers in the foyer and dining room can detach from the ceiling, swinging like massive flails or dropping on victims from above. Shards of crystal spray like shrapnel.</p>

<h3>Living Chandelier</h3>
<p><em>Large construct, unaligned</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13 (natural armor)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 58 (9d10 + 9)<br>

<tr><td>16 (+3)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>13 (+1)</td><td>1 (-5)</td><td>5 (-3)</td><td>1 (-5)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Damage Vulnerabilities</strong> thunder<br>
<strong>Damage Resistances</strong> piercing and slashing from nonmagical attacks<br>
<strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 7<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> —<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 3 (700 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The chandelier sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This light can be suppressed or restored as a bonus action.</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While hanging from the ceiling and motionless, the chandelier is indistinguishable from a normal chandelier.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The chandelier makes two attacks: one with its swing and one with crystal shards.</p>

<p><strong>Swing.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal Shards.</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) piercing damage.</p>

<p><strong>Drop (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The chandelier drops onto a creature directly beneath it. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained beneath the chandelier. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not restrained. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>Chandeliers start combat by using Drop on a clustered group or high-priority target. After dropping, they hover and attack with Swing and Crystal Shards. They use Illumination strategically—bright light to negate darkvision, or darkness to create chaos.</p>

<p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> Thunder damage (from <em>shatter</em>, <em>thunderwave</em>, etc.) causes the crystal to vibrate and crack, dealing extra damage.</p>

<h2>Possessed Mirror</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"My reflection moved when I didn't. Then it stepped through the glass."</p>

<p>Mirrors in the manor don't reflect reality—they reflect possibilities, fears, and sometimes hostile duplicates. A possessed mirror can trap victims inside the glass or release evil reflections.</p>

<h3>Possessed Mirror</h3>
<p><em>Medium construct, lawful evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 11 (13 when manifested)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 27 (5d8 + 5)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 0 ft. (30 ft. when manifested)</p>

<table>
<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>
<tr><td>10 (+0)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>14 (+2)</td><td>10 (+0)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> Common (can speak through reflections)<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While motionless and not manifested, the mirror is indistinguishable from a normal mirror.</p>

<p><strong>Reflective Surface.</strong> The mirror has AC 11 and can be shattered with a single solid hit. However, shattering the mirror while it has a creature trapped inside traps that creature permanently (until <em>greater restoration</em> or similar magic).</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Manifest Reflection.</strong> The mirror creates an evil duplicate of one creature within 10 feet that it can see. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mirror and acts on the mirror's initiative. The duplicate uses the target's stat block but is hostile to everyone except the mirror and other House Horrors. The duplicate has half the target's current hit points. Only one duplicate can exist at a time. If the mirror is destroyed, the duplicate vanishes.</p>

<p><strong>Trap in Glass (Recharge 5-6).</strong> One creature within 5 feet of the mirror must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pulled into the mirror and trapped. While trapped, the creature is restrained and incapacitated, suspended in a mirror dimension. The creature can see and hear what happens near the mirror but cannot interact with the outside world. A trapped creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, escaping on a success. Alternatively, the mirror can release the creature as a bonus action, causing it to appear in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>Mirrors first trap a dangerous party member (the tank, the healer) in glass. Then they manifest evil reflections of other party members, forcing the party to fight themselves. The trapped ally can shout warnings but can't help. Breaking the mirror frees trapped creatures but destroys the mirror permanently.</p>

<p><strong>Roleplay Potential:</strong> The mirror can speak through reflections, taunting, lying, or offering false bargains: "Step through and I'll show you what you could have been."</p>

<h2>The Grandfather Clock</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"The clock struck thirteen. Then it struck at us."</p>

<p>The massive grandfather clock in the foyer is Yackle's oldest servant. It controls time within the manor (to a limited extent) and can age or de-age creatures with its strikes.</p>

<h3>The Grandfather Clock</h3>
<p><em>Large construct, neutral evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 15 (natural armor)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 68 (8d10 + 24)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 10 ft.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>
<tr><td>18 (+4)</td><td>6 (-2)</td><td>16 (+3)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>12 (+1)</td><td>8 (-1)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 11<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> understands Common but can't speak (communicates by chiming)<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 4 (1,100 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Immutable Form.</strong> The clock is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>

<p><strong>Temporal Anchor.</strong> The clock cannot be affected by time manipulation magic (such as <em>slow</em>, <em>haste</em>, or <em>time stop</em>).</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While motionless, the clock is indistinguishable from a normal grandfather clock.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The clock makes two pendulum attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Pendulum.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</p>

<p><strong>Temporal Strike (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The clock strikes its bell, releasing a wave of temporal energy. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, roll 1d6:
<ul>
<li><strong>1-2:</strong> Target is aged 1d10 years (gaining associated frailty—disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks for 1 hour)</li>
<li><strong>3-4:</strong> Target is de-aged 1d10 years (losing associated experience—disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks for 1 hour)</li>
<li><strong>5-6:</strong> Target is frozen in time for 1 round (paralyzed, cannot be moved or affected)</li>
</ul>
On a successful save, the target is unaffected.</p>

<p><strong>Strike Thirteen (1/Day).</strong> As an action, the clock strikes thirteen times—an impossible hour. All House Horrors within the manor regain 10 hit points and gain advantage on their next attack roll. All non-construct creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature hears each strike as a death knell counting down their remaining moments. They can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>The Grandfather Clock is a miniboss encounter. It guards the foyer or appears during the Phase 2 fight with Yackle. It uses Temporal Strike to debuff the party, then pounds them with Pendulum attacks. It saves Strike Thirteen for when multiple House Horrors are damaged—healing them and frightening the party simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Weakness:</strong> The clock is slow (10 ft. speed) and can be kited. However, it has high HP and AC, making it a tough nut to crack. Destroying the clock's face (focused attacks on "the face" could be a called shot—GM discretion) might disable Temporal Strike.</p>

<h2>Swarm of Silverware</h2>

<p class="flavor-text">"Knives. Hundreds of knives. Flying. Toward our faces."</p>

<p>The dining room's silverware animates en masse—forks, knives, spoons swirling like a metallic tornado. Individually harmless, but collectively deadly.</p>

<h3>Swarm of Silverware</h3>
<p><em>Medium swarm of Tiny constructs, unaligned</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 (natural armor)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 36 (8d8)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 0 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover)</p>

<table>
<tr><th>STR</th><th>DEX</th><th>CON</th><th>INT</th><th>WIS</th><th>CHA</th></tr>
<tr><td>10 (+0)</td><td>18 (+4)</td><td>10 (+0)</td><td>1 (-5)</td><td>5 (-3)</td><td>1 (-5)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Damage Resistances</strong> bludgeoning, piercing, slashing<br>
<strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br>
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned<br>
<strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 30 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 7<br>
<strong>Languages</strong> —<br>
<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Swarm.</strong> The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny object. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.</p>

<p><strong>False Appearance.</strong> While arranged on a table and motionless, the silverware is indistinguishable from normal dining utensils.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Cutting Swarm.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (4d6) slashing damage, or 7 (2d6) slashing damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.</p>

<p><strong>Blinding Assault (Recharge 5-6).</strong> The swarm specifically targets the eyes and faces of all creatures in its space. Each creature in the swarm's space must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not blinded.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>Swarms occupy a spellcaster's space and use Blinding Assault to shut them down. They're resistant to weapon attacks but vulnerable to area-of-effect spells like <em>burning hands</em> or <em>shatter</em>. Multiple swarms can emerge from the dining room during Yackle Phase 2.</p>

<h2>Encounter Building with House Horrors</h2>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>Suggested Encounters for The Witch's Wake:</strong></p>

<h3>Early Exploration (CR 2-3 total)</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Animated Furniture (chair ambush in parlor)</li>
<li>2 Creeping Shadows (stalking in dim hallways)</li>
<li>1 Malevolent Portrait (in the gallery)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mid-Adventure (CR 4-5 total)</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Strangling Carpet + 2 Animated Furniture</li>
<li>1 Living Chandelier + 1 Swarm of Silverware (dining room)</li>
<li>2 Possessed Mirrors + 2 Creeping Shadows (creates duplicates)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yackle Phase 2 (CR 7-8 total, alongside Yackle herself)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Grandfather Clock + 2 Animated Furniture + 1 Living Chandelier</li>
<li>OR: 3 Malevolent Portraits + 2 Swarms of Silverware + 1 Strangling Carpet</li>
<li>OR: Mix and match based on which rooms the party has cleared</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scaling Tip:</strong> When Yackle merges with the house (Phase 2), she can summon House Horrors as a lair action. Start with 2-3 horrors present, then add 1-2 more every 2-3 rounds to maintain pressure without overwhelming.</p>
</div>

---

<h2>Destroying House Horrors Permanently</h2>

<p>House Horrors are sustained by Yackle's magic. While she lives, destroyed horrors can reform given enough time (1d4 days). Once Yackle is defeated in Phase 3, all House Horrors collapse into mundane objects and cannot reanimate.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dispel magic</em> can incapacitate most horrors for 1 minute</li>
<li>Destroying the physical object works but Yackle can replace them</li>
<li>Trapping horrors in rooms and barricading doors buys time</li>
<li>Fire, acid, and radiant damage leave permanent marks even if the horror reforms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Permanent Solution:</strong> Defeat Yackle.</p>

---

<h2>Roleplaying House Horrors</h2>

<p>House Horrors aren't intelligent (except the Grandfather Clock and Possessed Mirrors, which have limited cunning). Describe them as:
<ul>
<li>Moving with jerky, unnatural motions</li>
<li>Making grinding, creaking, or scraping sounds</li>
<li>Attacking with mechanical persistence—no fear, no hesitation</li>
<li>Collapsing into inert objects when destroyed (the chair falls apart, the shadow dissipates)</li>
</ul>

<p>The house itself is Yackle's body during Phase 2. When House Horrors attack, it's the manor striking like an immune system defending against infection.</p>
