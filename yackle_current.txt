</div>

<p class="flavor-text">"I have been many things. I have been young and old, beautiful and forgotten, alive and... something else. What I will be next depends on you, dear heirs."</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Yackle is the central antagonist of <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake', 'The Witch\'s Wake'); return false;">The Witch's Wake</a>. She is an ancient practitioner of pre-Lurline magic who has extended her life through a series of horrific rituals, consuming the memories and life force of others to fuel her immortality. She is not merely a witch—she is what remains when ambition outlives humanity.</p>

<h3>The Truth About Yackle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> Unknown. At least 150 years old, possibly much older.</li>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> Student of the Kumbric Witch, or possibly the Kumbric Witch herself, fragmented and reformed.</li>
<li><strong>Current State:</strong> Dying. Her current body is failing. The inheritance scheme is a ritual to transfer her consciousness into a new vessel.</li>
<li><strong>The House:</strong> <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/yackles-estate', 'Yackle\'s Estate'); return false;">Yackle's Estate</a> is bound to her through decades of blood magic. It is an extension of her will.</li>
<li><strong>The Heirs:</strong> Not truly heirs—they are components of a ritual. Six will provide the "fuel" (memories, life force). One will provide the "vessel" (a new body for Yackle to inhabit).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personality & Roleplaying</h2>

<h3>As the Hidden Heir (Disguise)</h3>
<p>Yackle is playing the role of one of the six heirs who arrived at the estate. She is a consummate actor, having practiced deception for over a century.</p>

<p><strong>Mannerisms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Observes more than she speaks</li>
<li>Occasionally knows things she shouldn't (then covers with excuses)</li>
<li>Shows subtle contempt for the "greedy" heirs</li>
<li>Seems to know her way around the house</li>
<li>Touches objects with odd familiarity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Voice:</strong> Measured, calm, with occasional slips into archaic phrasing.</p>

<p><strong>Tells (Foreshadowing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never eats or drinks (claims fasting, nerves, etc.)</li>
<li>Casts no reflection in certain mirrors</li>
<li>Animals (if any) react with fear to her presence</li>
<li>She doesn't bleed if cut—or bleeds something greenish</li>
<li>Knows the names of servants who died decades ago</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Revealed</h3>
<p>Once her cover is blown (or she chooses to reveal herself), Yackle drops all pretense.</p>

<p><strong>Personality Revealed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contemptuous:</strong> Views the heirs as livestock, resources to be harvested</li>
<li><strong>Philosophical:</strong> Believes survival justifies any cost</li>
<li><strong>Lonely:</strong> Hints at profound isolation from living so long</li>
<li><strong>Desperate:</strong> This ritual MUST succeed or she will die</li>
<li><strong>Arrogant:</strong> Has escaped death for so long she believes she's beyond consequence</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sample Dialogue:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"You call me a monster? I am survival incarnate. You, with your brief little lives, can afford morality. I cannot. I will not die. Not tonight. Not ever."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"The Kumbric Witch taught me this: the only sin is ceasing to exist. Everything else—love, mercy, conscience—these are luxuries for those who have time. I have run out of time a dozen times over. And yet, here I am."
</blockquote>

<h2>Goals & Motivations</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Survive:</strong> Her current body is failing. She has days, perhaps hours left.</li>
<li><strong>Complete the Ritual:</strong> Transfer her consciousness into a new vessel (one of the heirs).</li>
<li><strong>Harvest the Others:</strong> The other five heirs must be drained to fuel the ritual.</li>
<li><strong>Become Eternal:</strong> This time, she believes she can achieve true immortality—not just延续 extension, but a permanent fusion of body and will.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What She Wants From Each Heir</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Vessel (Secret Witch Player):</strong> This heir has been marked. Yackle will transfer into them.</li>
<li><strong>The Others:</strong> Specific memories and life force:
  <ul>
    <li>One's courage</li>
    <li>One's curiosity</li>
    <li>One's love/grief</li>
    <li>One's ambition</li>
    <li>One's faith</li>
    <li>One's identity/sense of self</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Statistics</h2>

<h3>Phase 1: The Revealed Witch (CR 10)</h3>
<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> Yackle's disguise is broken, or she chooses to reveal herself. She fights as a powerful arcane caster, using the house as her lair.</p>

<li><strong>8th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>feeblemind</em></li>
<li><strong>9th level (1 slot):</strong> <em>time stop</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> Yackle makes two attacks with Withering Touch or casts a cantrip and makes one Withering Touch attack.</p>

<p><strong>Withering Touch.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (3d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>

<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>

<p>Yackle can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Yackle regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.</p>

<p><strong>Cantrip.</strong> Yackle casts a cantrip.</p>

<p><strong>Move.</strong> Yackle moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Yackle casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.</p>

<p><strong>Memory Drain (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> Yackle targets one creature she can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage and become stunned until the end of its next turn as Yackle tears a memory from its mind. Yackle regains hit points equal to half the psychic damage dealt.</p>

</div>

<h3>Phase 2: Merged with the House (CR 12)</h3>
<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> Yackle is reduced to half hit points (67 or lower) in Phase 1, OR the players interrupt the ritual before it completes. Yackle merges fully with the house, becoming a distributed consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>Change in Tactics:</strong> Yackle is now everywhere and nowhere. She can speak from any surface, attack from any direction, and the house itself becomes her weapon. She uses lair actions more frequently and cannot be "cornered."</p>

<div class="stat-block" style="border: 2px solid #8B4513; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #FFF8DC;">
<h4>Yackle-House Entity (Phase 2)</h4>
<p><em>Large monstrosity (living structure), neutral evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 17 (architectural hardness)<br>
<strong>Hit Points</strong> 180 (19d10 + 76)<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> 0 ft. (the house does not move, but Yackle's manifestations can appear anywhere within it)</p>

<strong>Challenge</strong> 12 (8,400 XP)</p>

<p><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong> If the house fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>

<p><strong>Omnipresent.</strong> Yackle can perceive everything within the house simultaneously. She cannot be surprised. Stealth and invisibility are ineffective against her.</p>

<p><strong>Bound to the House.</strong> Yackle cannot leave the house. If forced outside (via <em>banishment</em>, etc.), she can manifest a spectral form but has disadvantage on all rolls until she returns.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Existence.</strong> Yackle does not have a single body. Damage must be dealt to the house itself (attacking structural elements, destroying ritual anchors, etc.). Destroying a manifestation does not harm her directly.</p>

<p><strong>Regeneration.</strong> The house regains 20 hit points at the start of Yackle's turn if she has at least 1 hit point.</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> The house makes three attacks: any combination of Manifested Strike, Structural Assault, or casts a spell.</p>

<p><strong>Manifested Strike.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. (Yackle manifests a spectral limb from a wall, floor, or ceiling to strike.)</p>

<p><strong>Structural Assault.</strong> Yackle causes part of the house to attack. Choose one:
<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Debris:</strong> Targets in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage (half on success).</li>
<li><strong>Animated Furniture:</strong> 1d4 objects (chairs, tables, suits of armor) animate and attack as if using the <em>animate objects</em> spell (Yackle's spell save DC).</li>
<li><strong>Sealing Room:</strong> All doors and windows in one room seal shut. DC 20 Strength check to force open, or they remain closed until the end of the round.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> Yackle retains her spellcasting ability from Phase 1. However, she now casts spells from any point in the house (walls, floors, ceilings, mirrors, etc.).</p>

<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>

<p>The house can take 3 legendary actions (same options as Phase 1, plus):</p>

<p><strong>Shift Geometry (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The house rearranges itself. Doorways lead to different rooms. Staircases reverse direction. Players must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or become lost (disadvantage on navigation checks for 1 minute).</p>

<p><strong>Invoke Terror (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> All creatures in one room must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use their movement to flee toward the nearest exit. They can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.</p>

<h4>Lair Actions</h4>

<p>On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the house takes a lair action. Roll 1d6:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sealing Doors:</strong> All doors within 60 feet of a chosen point lock. DC 18 Strength to force.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Assault:</strong> 2d4 objects animate and attack.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Distortion:</strong> One creature repeats its last action (Wisdom save DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Memory Flash:</strong> All creatures in one room are stunned until the end of their next turn (Wisdom save DC 17 negates).</li>
<li><strong>Structural Collapse:</strong> Ceiling collapses in a 20-foot cube. Dexterity save DC 17 or take 4d10 bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Whispers of the Dead:</strong> All creatures in the house hear the voices of Yackle's previous victims. Wisdom save DC 17 or take 3d8 psychic damage and become frightened of Yackle for 1 minute.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3>How to Defeat Phase 2</h3>
<p>Yackle cannot be killed through normal damage in this phase. Players must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Destroy Ritual Anchors:</strong> Seven glowing points throughout the house (one per room) bind Yackle to the structure. Destroying all seven (AC 15, 30 HP each) weakens her and triggers Phase 3.</li>
<li><strong>Disrupt the Circle:</strong> In the Heart Chamber (basement), breaking the ritual circle (DC 18 Arcana check or dealing 50+ damage to it) forces Yackle into Phase 3.</li>
<li><strong>Exorcism:</strong> A character with divine magic can attempt to banish Yackle (contested Wisdom check: character's Wisdom + proficiency vs. Yackle's +9).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 3: Vulnerable Essence (CR 8)</h3>
<p><strong>When This Phase Occurs:</strong> The ritual anchors are destroyed, OR the ritual circle is broken, OR Yackle is forced out of the house-merge. She manifests in her true form—ancient, withered, desperate.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Description:</strong> Yackle appears as a desiccated crone, skin like parchment, eyes burning with green witchfire. She is visibly dying, her body crumbling even as she fights.</p>

<div class="stat-block" style="border: 2px solid #8B4513; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background: #FFF8DC;">
<h4>Yackle's True Form (Phase 3)</h4>
<p><em>Medium undead (lich-adjacent), neutral evil</em></p>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13 (withered flesh)<br>

<strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft.</p>

<p><strong>Dying Curse.</strong> When Yackle is reduced to 0 hit points, she does not die immediately. Instead, she has one final turn to cast a spell, deliver last words, or curse her killers. Then she crumbles to dust.</p>

<p><strong>Desperate Magic.</strong> Yackle casts all spells at maximum power (no need to upcast). However, each spell she casts costs her 10 hit points (self-damage, cannot be prevented).</p>

<p><strong>Spellcasting (Reduced).</strong> Yackle retains access to her spells but has fewer slots:
<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 20px;">
<li><strong>Cantrips:</strong> At will</li>
<li><strong>1st-3rd level:</strong> 2 slots each</li>
<li><strong>4th-5th level:</strong> 1 slot each</li>
<li><strong>6th+ level:</strong> None (she's too weak)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Actions</h4>

<p><strong>Withering Grasp.</strong> <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a humanoid, Yackle can attempt to possess it (DC 17 Charisma save to resist). On a failed save, Yackle's consciousness enters the target's body (this is her last-ditch attempt to complete the ritual).</p>

<p><strong>Final Curse (1/lifetime).</strong> As Yackle dies, she can curse one creature she can see. That creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, choose one:
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory Curse:</strong> The creature forgets a specific person or event (GM's choice or player's choice with consent).</li>
<li><strong>Aging Curse:</strong> The creature ages 2d10 years instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Haunting Curse:</strong> The creature is haunted by visions of Yackle's victims. Disadvantage on Wisdom saves for 7 days.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Legendary Actions</h4>

<p>Yackle has 2 legendary actions in this phase (not 3).</p>

</div>

<h3>Defeat Conditions</h3>

<p>Yackle can be defeated through:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Combat:</strong> Reduce her to 0 HP in Phase 3. She crumbles to dust.</li>
<li><strong>Ritual Completion (Twisted):</strong> Allow her to possess someone, then use <em>dispel magic</em>, <em>remove curse</em>, or similar magic to expel her (she dies when expelled).</li>
<li><strong>Mercy/Negotiation:</strong> Yackle is desperate. If offered a genuine alternative (a way to live without killing), she might accept. This requires extraordinary persuasion (DC 20+) and a creative solution (player-driven).</li>
<li><strong>Destroying the House:</strong> If the house collapses while she's merged (Phase 2), she's destroyed—but the players must escape first.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tactics by Phase</h2>

<h3>Phase 1 Tactics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yackle opens with <em>greater invisibility</em> or <em>dimension door</em> to reposition</li>
<li>Focuses fire on spellcasters and healers first</li>
<li>Uses <em>counterspell</em> liberally to shut down player magic</li>
<li>Casts <em>dominate person</em> to turn strong fighters against the party</li>
<li>Retreats through walls (via <em>dimension door</em>) if cornered</li>
<li>Uses Memory Drain legendary action to sustain herself</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 2 Tactics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yackle is everywhere—she attacks from unexpected angles</li>
<li>Seals players in rooms, separating them</li>
<li>Animates furniture and portraits to overwhelm</li>
<li>Uses lair actions to create chaos and fear</li>
<li>Attempts to drive players mad with whispers and memory flashes</li>
<li>If players are destroying anchors, she focuses all attacks on them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 3 Tactics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desperate and reckless—casts high-damage spells despite self-harm</li>
<li>Attempts to possess the vessel (the secret witch player if possible)</li>
<li>Uses terrain and remaining house features for cover</li>
<li>If near death, offers bargains, lies, begs</li>
<li>Final act: curses the player who dealt the killing blow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Yackle's Death</h2>

<p>When Yackle is finally defeated, give her a memorable final moment:</p>

<blockquote>
She crumbles, her ancient body turning to dust and ash. For a moment, you see her as she once was—young, brilliant, terrified of death. Then that vision fades. Her last words echo in the silent house: "I only wanted... to see tomorrow." The house groans. The walls crack. You have minutes to escape before it collapses entirely.
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, if shown mercy:</p>

<blockquote>
She stares at you, disbelieving. "You would... spare me?" For the first time in a century, Yackle weeps. "I don't remember how to be grateful." She fades, not into death, but into something else—perhaps a final rest, perhaps a chance to be reborn without the weight of her crimes. The house sighs, released from its bondage.
</blockquote>

<h2>Yackle's Backstory (For GM Reference)</h2>

<p>Yackle was once a student at Shiz, brilliant and ambitious. She sought out the Kumbric Witch (or fragments of her knowledge) and learned the secrets of life extension. Her first ritual required the death of a lover. Her second, a friend. By the tenth, she had stopped counting.</p>

<p>Over decades, she has:
<ul>
<li>Inhabited at least four different bodies</li>
<li>Consumed the memories of 30+ victims</li>
<li>Become something neither living nor dead</li>
<li>Lost most of her humanity but retained her terror of oblivion</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>She is not evil for evil's sake—she is what happens when the fear of death consumes everything else.</p>
