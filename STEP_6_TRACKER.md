## Approach Strategy

### Phase 1: Essential Spells (Priority)
Focus on creating the most iconic and referenced spells first:
- Grimmerie spells referenced in class pages
- Core Unionist/Lurlinite spells
- Witch tradition essentials

### Phase 2: Equipment Basics
Create the fundamental equipment pages:
- Armor table
- Weapons table
- Basic gear

### Phase 3: Magic Items by Rarity
Work through magic items systematically:
- Artifacts first (most complex, most referenced)
- Then legendary, very rare, rare, uncommon, common
- Cursed items last

### Phase 4: Phenomena & Specialized Content
- Magical phenomena pages
- Trade goods, poisons, vehicles
- Final polish and cross-linking

---

## Page Count Estimate

- **Spells:** ~80 pages (all traditions)
- **Magical Phenomena:** 11 pages
- **Equipment:** ~8 pages (armor, weapons, gear, tools, mounts, trade, poisons)
- **Magic Items:** 70 pages (67 items + 3 artifacts)

**Total:** ~170 pages
