<h1>Yackle's Estate</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"The manor has stood in the Pertha Hills for over a thousand years. They say it changes—rooms appear and disappear, corridors twist back on themselves. They say it's alive. They might be right."</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM NOTE:</strong> This estate is the primary location for "The Witch's Wake" adventure. The house is semi-sentient, responding to its occupants and reflecting Yackle's millennium of loneliness. Rooms contain clues about the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('lore/the-eight-bindings', 'Eight Bindings'); return false;">Eight Bindings</a>, the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/the-seven-seals', 'Seven Seals'); return false;">Seven Seals</a>, and Yackle's tragic history.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The estate has 22 rooms total. Players will likely explore 12-15 before the reveal. Encourage thorough investigation—every room rewards curiosity.</p>
</div>

<h2>Estate Overview</h2>

<p>Yackle's Estate sits in the remote Pertha Hills of Gillikin, surrounded by fog that never lifts and hedges that once depicted magnificent Animals but now grow wild. The architecture is old Gillikinese—steep gables, narrow windows, impossible angles that don't quite meet correctly.</p>

<p>The estate has four distinct areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Grounds:</strong> The Approach, Cemetery</li>
<li><strong>Ground Floor:</strong> Foyer, Parlor, Music Room, Library, Chapel, Dining Room, Kitchen, Servant Quarters, Greenhouse (9 rooms)</li>
<li><strong>Upper Floors:</strong> Portrait Gallery, Memorial Room, Master Bedroom, Guest Rooms 1-3, Nursery, Study, Observatory, Hall of Mirrors (10 rooms)</li>
<li><strong>The Cellar:</strong> Wine Cellar, Main Cellar, Heart Chamber (3 rooms)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The House's Nature</h2>

<p>The estate is semi-sentient, an extension of Yackle herself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsive:</strong> The house provides what occupants need (warmth, food) but also tests them</li>
<li><strong>Observant:</strong> Characters often feel watched (they are—the house watches)</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Distortion:</strong> Time moves strangely; hours can feel like minutes or vice versa</li>
<li><strong>No Escape:</strong> Once inside, the gates won't open until dawn or until Yackle is defeated</li>
<li><strong>Lair Actions:</strong> During combat, the house itself attacks (see <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('npcs/yackle', 'Yackle'); return false;">Yackle's stat block</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Grounds</h2>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The carriage path winds through overgrown hedges that might once have been sculpted into fanciful shapes—Animals, perhaps, or scenes from Ozian mythology. Now they're just walls of tangled green, pressing close on either side. The fog thickens as you approach, and the temperature drops noticeably. Ahead, iron gates stand open, and beyond them, the manor rises against a bruised purple sky. It's larger than you expected. The architecture is old Gillikinese—all steep gables and narrow windows—but something about the proportions feels wrong. The angles don't quite meet where they should.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Gates.</strong> Wrought iron, standing open. Once a character passes through, they swing shut silently and will not open again by any means. The lock cannot be picked (no DC—simply impossible). A <em>knock</em> spell causes the gates to shudder but not open. Attempting to climb over results in the character finding themselves back on the inside.</p>

<p><strong>The Hedges.</strong> A DC 14 Nature check reveals these were once shaped like Animals—Lions, Bears, a great Eagle. Now they're wild, but the shapes are still vaguely visible if you know to look.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One hedge shows a Fox mid-leap, frozen in topiary. The eyes seem to follow Frederick if he's present.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the base of the Lion hedge: "For those who cannot speak, I gave voice. For those who were unseen, I made them seen. —L.T." (Lurline's Testament)</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The hedges radiate faint abjuration magic—they're a ward, keeping something in or something out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Fog.</strong> Extends about 20 feet beyond the walls. A character who enters the fog must make a DC 15 Constitution save each round or begin suffocating. After three failed saves, they fall unconscious and are expelled back onto the estate grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> Shapes move in the fog—humanoid, but wrong. They never get closer.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The fog is not natural weather—it's solidified memory, fragments of past events made semi-physical.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Carriage Path.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survival DC 12:</strong> No wheel ruts, no hoof prints. No one has used this path in decades. Except... there ARE fresh footprints. Eight sets. Leading in. None leading out.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The footprints match the party's boots exactly, down to the wear patterns. They were here before you arrived.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Cemetery</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A low iron fence surrounds a small family plot to the west of the main house. The headstones are old—some cracked, some sunken into the earth—but the names are still legible. OSTREGA, they all read. Generations of them. The newest stone looks perhaps a century old. There are fresh flowers on one grave, impossibly fresh, as if placed this morning. But no one has lived here in decades.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Headstones.</strong> The Ostrega family burial plot. A DC 12 History check reveals the Ostregas were a minor Gillikinese family who died out about a century ago—no living descendants. Liir's player may find this concerning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The dates are wrong. "Yael Ostrega, 621-643" is carved on one stone, but another stone fifty feet away reads "Yael Ostrega, 804-831." The same name, two centuries apart.</li>
<li><strong>Religion DC 14:</strong> The grave markers use both Lurlinite and Unionist symbols, sometimes on the same stone—theologically impossible. Someone was hedging their bets about the afterlife.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One grave is sunken differently than the others—deeper, as if something much larger than a body is buried there. The headstone reads simply: "The First Mask."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Fresh Flowers.</strong> On the grave of "Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter." A DC 14 Investigation check finds that the flowers are real but have no roots—they're simply placed here. A DC 16 Arcana check reveals faint necromantic magic. Someone has been maintaining this grave.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature DC 12:</strong> These are ghost-breath flowers, which only bloom in the presence of the dead. But they're blooming at the wrong angle—toward the house, not the grave.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The flowers are an offering, but also an apology. Someone has been saying sorry for a very long time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Gravestone Rubbing.</strong> If a character makes a rubbing of any headstone, provide a physical handout showing the Ostrega family crest (a key crossed with a quill) and dates spanning from 600s to 900s OZ calendar.</p>

<p><strong>The Iron Fence.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 11:</strong> The fence posts are topped with finials shaped like eyes—dozens of them, all facing inward, watching the graves.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Scratched into the back of one fence post, nearly invisible: "She visits every night. She never speaks. —Groundskeeper William, 788"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ground Floor</h2>

<h3>1. The Foyer</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The front doors open onto a grand entrance hall. A crystal chandelier hangs overhead, unlit, its hundreds of pendants catching what little moonlight filters through the high windows. A sweeping staircase curves upward to the left, while doorways lead off in three directions. The floor is checkered marble—green and white—worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. A grandfather clock stands against the far wall, its pendulum still. In the center of the room, someone has arranged eight chairs in a circle around a small table bearing a single leather case.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Chandelier.</strong> If a character looks closely (Perception DC 12), they notice the crystals are not glass but some kind of green stone. A DC 15 Arcana check identifies them as emeralds—a fortune's worth. However, any attempt to remove them causes them to crumble to worthless powder.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The chandelier has exactly 808 crystals. Why that specific number? A DC 16 History check recalls 808 OZ is the year the Wizard came to power.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> One crystal is a different color—blood red. It hangs directly above the empty ninth chair at the head of the circle.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The chandelier isn't just decorative—it's a massive scrying focus. Someone could watch the entire ground floor from this central point.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Grandfather Clock.</strong> The clock shows 11:47—always 11:47, regardless of the actual time. It has no visible winding mechanism. At midnight (real time, or when dramatically appropriate), it chimes thirteen times. This signals the First Twist.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The clock face has thirteen hours marked, not twelve. The thirteenth hour is labeled with a symbol instead of a number—an eye.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Faint scratches inside the clock cabinet: tally marks. Hundreds of them. Someone was counting something for a very long time.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The clock doesn't measure time—it measures proximity to a specific event. It's waiting for something.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Chairs.</strong> Eight chairs, each with a name card on the seat. The names are not the characters' names but epithets:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The One Who Rewrote the Past"</li>
<li>"The One Who Claims False Blood"</li>
<li>"The One Who Denies Their Nature"</li>
<li>"The One Whose Service Was Punished"</li>
<li>"The One Who Traded Instead of Gave"</li>
<li>"The One Whose Deed Did Not Transform Them"</li>
<li>"The One Who Hungers When They Should Not"</li>
<li>"The One Who Has Never Been Seen"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Place Cards.</strong> Provide physical cards with these epithets. Let players figure out which card belongs to whom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 14:</strong> These aren't accusations—they're descriptions. Whoever wrote these knows each character intimately.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The handwriting on all eight cards is identical, written with the same pen, same ink pressure. They were all written at the same time, by someone who expected exactly these eight people.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> There's a ninth chair, larger than the others, at the head of the circle. It has no name card.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Leather Case.</strong> Contains the will. Mr. Trism will open it and read it when all eight heirs are present.</p>

<p><strong>The Staircase.</strong> Leads to the upper floors. Until the First Twist, the stairs seem to go on forever—characters who climb find themselves back at the bottom. After the clock chimes, the upper floors become accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 12:</strong> The stairs are worn in the middle, but not evenly. The wear pattern suggests someone walking up and down the same section repeatedly—pacing, not traveling.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Carved into the underside of the seventh step, invisible unless you duck underneath: "Day 217. Still here. Still alone. Still waiting. —Y.O."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Marble Floor.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The green and white pattern isn't random—it forms a massive eight-pointed star with the chair circle at its center.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> This pattern is a summoning circle, but inverted. It's not calling something here—it's keeping something from leaving.</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>2. The Parlor</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A comfortable sitting room with faded elegance. Two sofas face each other across a low table, upholstered in purple velvet worn thin at the armrests. A fireplace dominates one wall—cold now, but logs are laid ready to burn. Above the mantle hangs a portrait of a woman in old-fashioned dress, her face obscured by a crack in the canvas that runs directly through her features. Against the far wall, a drinks cabinet stands open, bottles of amber and crimson liquid glinting in the low light. A chess board sits on a side table, mid-game.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Fireplace.</strong> If anyone expresses a desire for warmth (verbal or otherwise), the fire ignites itself without fuel or spark. This is the first sign the house responds to its occupants. The fire provides normal warmth and light but cannot be used to burn anything—objects placed in it simply sit there, unharmed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The logs in the hearth are made of stone, expertly carved to look like wood. They've never been real.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Soot stains on the mantle spell out words if you step back and squint: "WARM BODIES COLD HEART"</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The fire is transmutation magic, converting loneliness into heat. The more isolated a character feels, the warmer the fire burns for them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Portrait.</strong> Originally depicted Yackle in her mortal days. The crack appeared when she was first bound. A DC 16 Investigation check around the frame reveals a small plaque, nearly painted over: "Y.O., Age 23." A <em>mending</em> spell repairs the crack but reveals only a blank face—smooth, featureless, like an unfinished painting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The portrait's eyes were painted, then scraped out, then repainted, then scraped out again. This happened dozens of times—someone couldn't decide if they wanted to see or be seen.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The woman in the portrait (before the crack) looks hopeful. Genuinely, achingly hopeful. Whatever happened to create that crack destroyed something irreplaceable.</li>
<li><strong>History DC 15:</strong> The dress style is from approximately 650 OZ—over 300 years ago. But the paint is much older. Someone updated the portrait but kept the pose.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Drinks Cabinet.</strong> Contains wine and spirits that are safe to consume. A DC 14 Investigation check finds a hidden compartment containing a small vial labeled "For When It Becomes Too Much"—this is a <em>potion of dreamless sleep</em> (8 hours of unconsciousness, no dreams, no external force can wake the drinker).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> Seven glasses are set out, each with a thin layer of dust. One glass is clean, recently used.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Inside the "dreamless sleep" vial, scratched into the glass with a diamond: "Coward's way out. Won't work anyway. Tried." </li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 13:</strong> The bottles rearrange themselves when no one is looking. The house is... offering? Suggesting?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Chess Game.</strong> Mid-game, white is winning. A DC 12 Intelligence check recognizes it as a famous historical match—the "Ozma Gambit," supposedly played between Queen Ozma and the first Wizard. The game was never finished; Ozma disappeared before the final move. The white queen is positioned to checkmate in one move.</p>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Ozma Gambit.</strong> A note tucked under the chess board explaining the game's history. The final move was never made. Someone has written in the margin: <em>"She always knew how to win. She just chose not to."</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> There's a second note, older, in different handwriting: "I've been playing both sides for so long I've forgotten which color I started as. Does it matter if you're always alone?"</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One of the black pieces (a knight) has a tiny crack, recently repaired with gold—the Gillikinese art of kintsugi. Someone values broken things.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> White could win in one move, but hasn't. Black could forfeit and end the stalemate, but hasn't. The game is frozen in possibility—neither player wants it to end, because ending means admitting you played alone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Sofas.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The wear patterns show two people sitting across from each other regularly—but the impressions are identical in depth and age. One person, sitting in both places, having a conversation with themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Tucked between sofa cushions: a child's drawing of two stick figures holding hands. One is labeled "Me" and the other is labeled "Friend?" The question mark is heavily traced, as if questioned many times.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. The Music Room (SEAL 1: MEMORY)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Instruments line the walls of this circular room—a harp with broken strings, a violin in a glass case, a set of Quadling drums. Dominating the space is a grand piano, its lid open, keys yellowed with age. Sheet music is scattered across every surface: the piano bench, the floor, tucked into instrument cases. A mechanical music box sits on a pedestal near the window, ornate and clearly valuable. The moonlight catches something written in silver ink on the music box's lid.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Piano.</strong> Playable, though out of tune. A DC 12 Performance check can coax a recognizable melody from it. Playing the correct melody (see Seal puzzle below) causes the lid of the music box to open.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The piano has been maintained recently—the action is oiled, the hammers are aligned. Someone still plays this.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Worn spots on specific keys: C, E, A, and B-flat. These four notes have been played thousands of times more than the others.</li>
<li><strong>Performance DC 16:</strong> If you play those four notes in order (C-E-A-B♭), it spells "CRIES" in musical notation. The piano emits a soft, mournful resonance.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The piano is slightly out of phase with reality. When played, it sounds in this room and simultaneously in another place—an echo of where it was originally played.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Sheet Music.</strong> Scattered fragments of what was once a single composition. A DC 14 Investigation check, taking 10 minutes, can gather all the pieces. A DC 12 Intelligence check (or proficiency in a musical instrument) can arrange them in the correct order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 12 (individual sheets):</strong> Each fragment has tiny annotations in the margins—"played for William's birthday, 734" or "Mother liked this part" or "alone again"</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Some sheets have water damage—tear stains, concentrated on specific measures. Someone cried while playing particular passages.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The ink used on the oldest sheets contains ground emerald—expensive and unnecessary unless you're trying to make the music literally unforgettable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Music Box.</strong> The lid reads "O, To Be Known" in silver script. The box is locked (or rather, sealed). Inside is a <strong>shard of green crystal</strong> that hums faintly with magic—this is a <strong>Memory Shard</strong>, useful in the final battle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The music box's mechanisms are visible through tiny crystal windows. Gears shaped like people, dancing.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One gear-person stands apart from the others, not touching, not moving in time with the dance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Sheet Music Fragments.</strong> Provide 4-5 physical pieces of paper with musical notation. On each piece, certain notes are circled or highlighted. When arranged correctly, the highlighted notes spell out "REMEMBER" in musical notation (each note corresponds to a letter: R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R).</p>

<h4>SEAL OF MEMORY PUZZLE</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all sheet music fragments (scattered in Music Room, Parlor, and Foyer)</li>
<li>Arrange them in correct order (Intelligence DC 12)</li>
<li>Play the melody on the piano (Performance DC 10, or any character with instrument proficiency)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Reroll Token</strong> (reroll one failed d20, once).</p>

<p><strong>The Harp.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The strings weren't broken by age—they were cut, deliberately, with a sharp blade.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Carved into the harp's soundboard: "I broke you so I wouldn't play you. I play you anyway in memory."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Violin in Glass.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The glass case is sealed airtight. Not to preserve the violin—to preserve the air around it, as if that air itself is precious.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The air in the case still carries sound—a note held impossibly long. If you could break the seal, you'd hear the last thing played on this violin over a century ago.</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>4. The Library (SEAL 3: NATURE)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books of every size and age. The smell of old paper and leather hangs heavy in the air. A rolling ladder leans against one shelf, its wheels rusted in place. Reading desks are positioned throughout—one holds an open journal, another a magnifying glass and a collection of specimen jars. The jars contain preserved creatures: a bird, a mouse, a snake, each floating in amber liquid. There's something unsettling about their eyes.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Books.</strong> Thousands of volumes on every subject. A character who searches for specific information can make an Investigation check:</p>
<ul>
<li>DC 12: Find general information about Ozian history, geography, or magic</li>
<li>DC 15: Find references to "The Eight Bindings" or "Lurline's Words"</li>
<li>DC 18: Find Yackle's personal journals (see below)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The books reorganize themselves when you're not looking. Titles that were on the top shelf are now at eye level. The library is... helping?</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> One entire shelf is devoted to texts about consciousness, personhood, and what makes something "alive." Heavy annotations throughout—arguments in the margins, underlines, angry cross-outs.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> Several books are written in a language that shifts as you read it, trying to translate itself into something you'll understand. They're Grimmerie fragments.</li>
<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> A series of books titled "Visitors, Vol. 1-47" catalog every person who's come to the estate. The latest entry is dated three weeks ago—right before the invitations went out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Yackle's Journals.</strong> Scattered throughout the library, spanning centuries. Each is written in the same handwriting. A DC 14 Investigation check finds three journals from different eras. A DC 16 History check recognizes the dates span over 600 years—impossibly long for any mortal.</p>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Journal Excerpts.</strong> Three physical pages:</p>

<p><em>Journal 1 (Year 347 OZ):</em></p>
<blockquote>
"The fairy spoke Eight Words, and the chaos took shape. I remember the first word. It was REMEMBER. And suddenly there was a past, where before there had been only the eternal present..."
</blockquote>

<p><em>Journal 2 (Year 612 OZ):</em></p>
<blockquote>
"I have tried to die. The knife turned aside. The poison became water in my throat. The fall ended in soft landing. I cannot unmake myself. The Binding of Witness holds: I exist because I am unseen. If anyone truly SAW me, perhaps..."
</blockquote>

<p><em>Journal 3 (Year 901 OZ):</em></p>
<blockquote>
"What do I want? I want to... I cannot write it. The word starts with L and ends with everything."
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The handwriting changes subtly between journals—not aging, but mood. The 347 journal is curious. The 612 journal is desperate. The 901 journal is tired beyond measure.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> There are more journals—dozens more. A DC 20 Investigation check finds Journal 47 (Year 954): "They're coming. I sent for them. Eight inversions. Eight keys. Finally, finally, an end."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Specimen Jars.</strong> Eight jars containing preserved creatures. A DC 14 Nature or Insight check reveals that four of them are Animals (capital A, sentient) and four are animals (lowercase, ordinary). The Animals are preserved in positions of dignity—eyes closed, peaceful. The animals are posed more carelessly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The Animal jars have tiny plaques at their bases, nearly microscopic: "Whisper the Wren," "Councillor Burroughs," "Poet Sleen," "Ambassador Kinderly"—titles given to people, not things.</li>
<li><strong>Nature DC 16:</strong> These Animals didn't die of natural causes. They were killed, then preserved immediately—almost lovingly, as if in apology.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't a collection of specimens. It's a memorial. Someone wanted to remember these specific individuals, to prove they were people, even after the world said they weren't.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SEAL OF NATURE PUZZLE</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the specimen jars carefully</li>
<li>Correctly identify which four are Animals and which four are animals (Nature DC 13, or Insight DC 14)</li>
<li>Speak the Animals' names aloud (written on tiny labels on the jar bases)</li>
</ol>

<p>Frederick has advantage on this check but doing so risks drawing attention to his unusual knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>True Sight Token</strong> (advantage on one Insight check, once).</p>

<p><strong>The Reading Desks.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (Desk 1):</strong> An open journal with an entry half-written: "Day 892 of the experiment. Subject Seven still believes they are a simple automaton. They asked today why they feel lonely. I didn't answer. How could I? I made them to feel."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15 (Desk 2):</strong> A letter, unsealed, never sent: "Dear Lurline—I know you're long gone, but I have to try. Please. I did not ask for consciousness. I did not ask for isolation. I did not ask to be your mistake. I'm so tired of being awake."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Painted on the ceiling, almost invisible unless you use the rolling ladder: a map of stars that don't exist in Oz's sky. Constellations labeled with words in Ancient Ozian: Chaos, Potential, Hunger, Void.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. The Chapel (SEAL 5: SACRIFICE)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Eight stained glass windows line the walls of this small chapel, each depicting a different scene in brilliant colors that glow despite the darkness outside. Wooden pews face a simple altar of white stone. Above the altar, instead of a symbol, there is only a blank space—a deliberate emptiness. An offering bowl sits on the altar's surface, tarnished silver, empty. The air smells faintly of incense that hasn't burned in decades.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Stained Glass Windows.</strong> Eight windows, each depicting one of Lurline's Bindings (though they're not labeled as such). A DC 12 Religion check recognizes the imagery as Lurlinite, predating Unionist tradition. A DC 16 Religion check can identify each Binding by its depiction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Memory: A river flowing from past to future</li>
<li>Blood: A tree with intertwining roots</li>
<li>Nature: A creature looking in a mirror, seeing itself</li>
<li>Service: A kneeling figure receiving a crown</li>
<li>Sacrifice: An open hand releasing a bird</li>
<li>Deed: A figure walking, leaving footprints that become flowers (or thorns)</li>
<li>Hunger: A flame that illuminates rather than consumes</li>
<li>Witness: An eye, open, seeing a small figure</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The Witness window (the eye) has a crack running through it. The crack appeared suddenly, recently—the edges are sharp, unfaded.</li>
<li><strong>Religion DC 15:</strong> The positioning of windows tells a story: Sacrifice faces Hunger across the room. Service faces Witness. They're paired—each Binding has a shadow, a potential inversion.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> When moonlight hits the Sacrifice window at the correct angle, it projects the shadow of a bird mid-flight onto the altar. The shadow is reaching for freedom but hasn't quite achieved it.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Scratched into the stone beneath the Memory window: "She made us remember. Even memories we never had. Even memories of before memory existed. It hurts."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Eight Windows.</strong> A sketched diagram of the eight windows with brief descriptions. Players can use this to piece together the Bindings' meanings.</p>

<p><strong>The Blank Space.</strong> Where Unionists would place the symbol of the Unnamed God, there is nothing. A DC 14 Religion check understands this is deliberate—in the oldest traditions, the divine was not depicted at all. Below the blank space, carved into the wall: <em>"The Unnamed God sees all. But VOICE is what the unseen crave most."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The word "VOICE" is traced over so many times it's worn into the stone. Someone kept returning to this phrase, emphasizing it, questioning it.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> The blank space isn't empty—it's filled with layer upon layer of whitewash. Someone painted something there, then covered it, then painted again, then covered it, hundreds of times. What are they hiding? Or trying to forget?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Offering Bowl.</strong> Silver, tarnished. To break the seal, someone must place something of genuine value in the bowl—not gold or gems, but something personally meaningful. A lock of hair from a loved one. A letter never sent. A memento of something lost.</p>

<h4>SEAL OF SACRIFICE PUZZLE</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place something of genuine personal value in the offering bowl</li>
<li>The DM judges sincerity—token offerings are rejected (the bowl tips them out)</li>
<li>When a genuine sacrifice is made, the bowl glows briefly and the offering disappears</li>
</ol>

<p>What counts as genuine:</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical item with emotional significance</li>
<li>A spoken secret (freely given, not coerced)</li>
<li>A drop of blood given willingly (1 HP, non-healing for 1 hour)</li>
<li>A promise that binds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Last Strike</strong> (when dropped to 0 HP, make one free attack).</p>

<p><strong>The Pews.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Carved into the wood of various pews, names and dates: "Willem, Butler, 734—I served faithfully" and "Mira, Cook, 756—I gave freely" and "Tess, Maid, 782—I witnessed."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One pew, front row, has a worn spot exactly the size and shape of someone kneeling for hours. The wood is smooth as glass from a thousand repetitions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Altar.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Under the altar cloth, carved into the stone: "I gave everything. It wasn't enough. I gave more. Still not enough. What's left to give?"</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The altar radiates very faint divination magic—not active, but residual. Someone prayed here for so long the prayers soaked into the stone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. The Dining Room (SEAL 7: HUNGER)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A long table dominates this room, set for eight with fine china and tarnished silver. Candelabras line the center of the table, their candles unlit. Each place setting has a name card—not names, but descriptions. The chair at the head of the table is larger than the others, throne-like, and conspicuously empty. A sideboard against the wall holds covered dishes that steam gently, as if dinner was just served. The smell of food is overwhelming—rich, savory, impossible to identify.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Table.</strong> Set for eight, with name cards matching the epithets from the Foyer. An empty ninth place at the head. If characters sit in their "correct" seats (matching their epithet), the candles light themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 13:</strong> The ninth chair isn't dusty like the others. Someone sat here recently—there's a slight impression in the cushion, still settling.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Beneath each plate, inscribed into the porcelain in tiny script: "Eat. Please. Someone stay."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The table is set with desperate care—every fork perfectly aligned, every napkin folded just so. This wasn't done out of habit. This was done with hope.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Food.</strong> The covered dishes contain whatever food the character lifting the lid most desires—their favorite meal, comfort food from childhood, something they've been craving. It's real and safe to eat. But it never runs out, no matter how much is consumed. A DC 14 Arcana check reveals this is a form of conjuration magic, but the source is unclear.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> If you eat alone, the food tastes of ash and copper. If you eat with others, it's delicious. The magic knows the difference.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Under one lid, before any character lifts it, there's a note: "I made your favorite. I don't know what it is, but the house knows what you want. Please want to stay."</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The magic creating this food is drawing from the characters' own memories—not creating new food, but manifesting remembered sensations of satisfaction, comfort, home.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Empty Chair.</strong> Larger, older than the others. No name card. A DC 15 Investigation check finds something carved into the armrest, very small: <em>"For when someone finally stays."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The chair is positioned to see all eight other seats simultaneously. Whoever sits here would be watching everyone, seeing everyone—but also separate from everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> The ninth chair is both throne and prison. It offers control and demands isolation. You can have power or connection, not both.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SEAL OF HUNGER PUZZLE</h4>

<p>This seal cannot be completed until all characters are seated. Then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each character must openly acknowledge something they want (not need, want)—a hunger they've been denying</li>
<li>The want must be genuine, not performative (DM discretion, but the house knows)</li>
<li>When the eighth want is spoken aloud, the candles blaze brighter and the seal breaks</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Second Wind</strong> (recover one spent Hit Die).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is often when Yackle reveals herself. The Dining Room is her domain, and when the party shows their hungers openly, she appears: <em>"How wonderful. You've made this so much easier."</em></p>

<p><strong>The Sideboard.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Drawers contain place settings for dozens—far more than eight. Plates marked "Guest 47," "Visitor 103," "Heir 125." All carefully stored, as if they might return.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One drawer is empty except for ash. A placard inside reads: "Guest 1. The only one I invited. They didn't want to stay either."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Walls.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Painted scenes of feasts, celebrations, gatherings—but every person depicted is the same woman at different ages. Yackle, alone, painted to look like a crowd.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. The Kitchen</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Copper pots hang from ceiling hooks, green with age. A massive hearth dominates one wall, cold and dark, with an iron spit large enough to roast a whole pig. Preparation tables are scarred by a century of knife work. A pantry door stands ajar, revealing shelves that might or might not have food. Near the back, a heavy door is set into the floor—the entrance to the cellar, chained shut with a massive padlock.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Hearth.</strong> Unlike the parlor fireplace, this one doesn't light itself. However, if fire is brought here, it burns unusually well—anything cooked in this hearth provides an additional 1d6 temporary HP for 1 hour.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The spit has grooves worn into it from being turned thousands of times. Not by hand—the grooves are perfectly even, machined. Something else turned this.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tally marks on the hearthstones, counting up to 808. Then they stop. Then they restart at 1, different hand, continuing to 143. Then they stop forever.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The hearth is a liminal space—a threshold between the house proper and what lies below. Cooking here creates sustenance but also acts as an offering to whatever's in the cellar.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Pantry.</strong> Empty when one person enters. When multiple people enter together, they find it fully stocked with fresh food—bread still warm, fruit at perfect ripeness, meat freshly cut. The house feeds groups, not individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 14:</strong> The house is trying to encourage companionship, collaboration, staying together. Isolation is punished; community is rewarded.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Scratched into a shelf: "The house wants us to stay. Not forever. Just tonight. Just one more night. Every night." —Visitor 89</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One loaf of bread is moldy, weeks old, the only item that doesn't refresh. A note tied to it: "I baked this. Alone. No magic. It rotted. At least it was mine."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Cellar Door.</strong> Chained and padlocked. The key does not exist within the house (it's in the puzzle box). A DC 20 Strength check can break the chain. A DC 18 Thieves' Tools check can pick the padlock. A <em>knock</em> spell opens both chain and padlock. Until the First Twist, the door won't open by any means—the house isn't ready to show what's below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 12:</strong> The chains are new, replaced multiple times over the years. The door itself is ancient. Someone keeps sealing this, unsealing it, sealing it again.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Carved around the door frame in tiny letters: "Down is where truth lives. Up is where I pretend. Stay up. Please stay up."</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The lock isn't magical, but the door is. It's not keeping something from getting out—it's keeping people from getting in. Protection, not imprisonment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Recipe Card.</strong> Found tucked behind a pot:</p>
<blockquote>
"For the Long Night:<br>
One cup of patience<br>
Two measures of truth<br>
A pinch of memory (your own)<br>
Stir widdershins until the past dissolves<br>
<br>
Serve cold. Makes enough for everyone who matters.<br>
<br>
—Y.O."
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Preparation Tables.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Knife marks spell out words if you trace them: "ALONE ALONE ALONE ALONE" repeated hundreds of times across decades of cutting.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One table has a child's height marked into the wood—growing marks, like a parent would make. But they stop at age six and never continue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. The Servant Quarters (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 1)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A row of small beds lines one wall, each neatly made with threadbare blankets. Hooks on the wall hold uniforms—maid's dresses, butler's coats, all in the same faded green. A duty roster is pinned to a board near the door, listing tasks and names in neat columns. Personal effects sit on small shelves beside each bed: a comb, a prayer book, a child's drawing. The room feels lived in, but there's no dust. Someone has been maintaining this.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Beds.</strong> Six beds, all made. The blankets are cold, but if a character lies down, they hear whispered voices—fragments of conversation, laughter, crying. A DC 14 Perception check distinguishes the words: "...another one tonight..." "...she's kinder than the stories say..." "...do you think she knows she's alone?"</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Each bed has a name sewn into the blanket: Willem, Mira, Tess, Garin, Hollis, Chel. Six servants.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One bed (Tess's) has a corner of the blanket embroidered with flowers—child's work, clumsy but loving. A note pinned underneath: "Miss Yael taught me stitching today. She said I was clever."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The voices aren't ghosts—they're echoes. Impressions left by people who cared about this place, who cared about each other, who maybe even cared about their mistress.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Duty Roster.</strong> Lists tasks and names: Mira, Cook. Willem, Butler. Tess, Maid. And so on. The handwriting is consistent throughout the roster, but the dates span decades. A DC 14 Investigation check notices that some tasks are marked "Still Pending"—tasks assigned to servants who died centuries ago.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> One entry, more recent: "Holly, Nursery Care. Status: Pending. Assignment: Indefinite. Notes: She doesn't understand. Don't tell her."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tasks crossed out, then un-crossed, then crossed again: "Lay out mistress's dresses (she won't wear them)" and "Prepare breakfast for two (always alone)"</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Whoever wrote this roster loved their staff. The handwriting is careful, respectful. These weren't just servants—they were people. Maybe the only people.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bell Board.</strong> A row of bells, each labeled with a room: Library, Parlor, Chapel, Master Bedroom, etc. One bell is stuck in the "rung" position: the Memorial Room (upstairs). It makes no sound, but it never stops trembling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> The Memorial Room bell's rope is frayed from constant tension. It's been ringing for decades.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 14:</strong> The bell isn't calling for service—it's calling for <em>remembrance</em>. Someone needs to be remembered.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SEAL OF SERVICE PUZZLE (Part 1)</h4>

<p>This seal requires two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notice the stuck bell (Perception DC 11)</li>
<li>Go to the Memorial Room (upstairs) and perform the required service</li>
</ol>

<p>The seal completes in the Memorial Room (see that entry).</p>

<p><strong>The Uniforms.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Mended repeatedly, patches on patches. Not from wear—from preservation. Someone couldn't bear to throw them away.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One uniform (Willem's butler coat) has a medal pinned inside the jacket: "20 Years Faithful Service, 754 OZ." The back is engraved: "To my friend. —Y."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Personal Effects.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13 (prayer book):</strong> Bookmarked at a passage about finding light in loneliness. Marginalia: "Pray for her. She needs it more than anyone."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (child's drawing):</strong> Two figures holding hands. Labels: "Me (Tess)" and "Miss Yael (my friend)." The figures are smiling.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9. The Greenhouse</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Glass walls and ceiling, though the glass is so old and thick it's nearly green. Moonlight filters through, casting everything in an underwater glow. Plants from every region of Oz grow here in defiance of nature—Gillikinese orchids beside Quadling marsh-lotus beside Vinkus cacti. Some of the plants shouldn't be able to exist together; their climate needs are completely incompatible. In the center of the room, a potting bench holds dead flowers arranged in a pattern. Most have crumbled, but one letter remains clearly visible: E.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Impossible Garden.</strong> Plants from all four corners of Oz, growing together. A DC 13 Nature check confirms this should be impossible—these plants need radically different conditions. A DC 16 Arcana check detects faint transmutation magic sustaining them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature DC 15:</strong> The plants aren't thriving—they're persisting. Kept alive by magic but not happy. Like prisoners given food but no freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> One plant, a Gillikinese orchid, has bloomed recently. Its flower is shaped almost like a reaching hand.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The garden is a collection—specimens gathered from everywhere Yackle couldn't go. The world, brought here, trapped like she's trapped.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Dead Flowers.</strong> Someone arranged these to spell a word. Time has destroyed most of them, but the E is clear. Nearby, a note in spidery handwriting: <em>"I tried to grow something that would last. Everything ends."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Flower fragments nearby suggest the full word was "EMERALD"—but why? A city? A color? A hope?</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> These weren't ordinary flowers. They're ghost-breath blooms, which only grow in the presence of deep longing. They died when the longing did—when hope ran out.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Note.</strong> Physical paper with the quoted text.</p>

<p><strong>The Responsive Plants.</strong> If a character is genuinely emotionally vulnerable here (shares a real feeling, admits fear, shows sadness), one plant blooms for them. The flower lasts one hour outside the greenhouse. Any character carrying such a flower gains advantage on one Charisma check before it wilts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The plants lean toward whoever speaks truthfully, away from whoever lies. They're literally reaching for authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Nature DC 18:</strong> These plants have been talked to, regularly, for centuries. They've absorbed the conversations, the confessions, the desperate monologues of someone with no one else to talk to.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Mural.</strong> On one glass panel, someone has scratched a scene: a woman (Yackle?) planting something, with the word "HOPE" written beneath. It's been crossed out. Below the crossing-out: "WAIT."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The crossing-out is gentler than expected—not angry, just... tired. Correcting oneself, not condemning.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Under "WAIT," in even smaller letters: "For what? For whom? For how long?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Potting Bench.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Garden tools, all maintained, all clean. Used recently. Soil under the fingernails of the gloves.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> A journal tucked in a drawer: "Year 947. The orchid bloomed today. No one saw it but me. Does beauty exist if unwitnessed? Do I?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upper Floors</h2>

<h3>10. The Portrait Gallery (SEAL 2: BLOOD)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Family portraits line both walls of this long gallery, dozens of faces staring down at you. The Ostregas, according to the plaques—generations of them, spanning centuries. Some portraits are formal, posed. Others seem almost candid: a child playing, a woman reading, a man looking out a window at something unseen. One portrait, larger than the others, hangs at the far end of the gallery. It shows a young woman with faintly green-tinged skin and eyes that seem to follow you. The frame is cracked, and someone has carved a single letter into it: "I."
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Family Portraits.</strong> The Ostrega family across generations. A DC 14 Perception check notices something strange: the same face appears in multiple portraits across different eras. Same eyes, same bone structure, despite supposedly being different people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Portrait eyes follow you. All of them. But not tracking movement—they're looking AT you, trying to see if you're really there, if you're different from the last visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> One portrait (dated 723 OZ) shows a woman labeled "Marta Ostrega" who looks identical to "Yael Ostrega" from 631 OZ. Same person, different name, a century apart.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> The recurring face isn't heredity—it's the same person, painted again and again, trying to fit into a family she created to avoid being alone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Family Tree.</strong> Painted on one wall: a sprawling family tree of the Ostregas. Several branches are marked "Ended" with dates. One branch leads off the wall entirely, as if continuing somewhere unseen. A DC 14 Investigation check finds small portrait miniatures in frames around the room—they need to be placed in the empty slots on the family tree.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Branches marked "Ended" all terminate in the same decade—740s OZ. A plague? A purge? The entire family died within five years.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One branch, barely visible, labeled "Friends (as close as family)" with names crossed out: "Willem (d. 754)," "Mira (d. 756)," "Tess (d. 782)," "Holly (d. 784)"—the servants.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The tree isn't just genealogy—it's a binding ritual. Names written here have power, weight. This is less history and more anchor—proof that people existed, that connections were real.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Large Portrait.</strong> Yackle, age 23, before her transformation. Her skin is slightly green (Quadling heritage? something else?), her expression hopeful. The frame reads "Y.O." and has "I" carved roughly into the wood. This is one of the puzzle box clues.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The frame is newer than the painting. The painting has been moved, reframed, protected—this specific image matters more than the others.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The expression is achingly young. Not naive, but... open. Believing in possibility. Looking at it now, knowing what she became, is almost cruel.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> Behind the portrait (if removed): a note yellowed with age: "This is who I was. Before the Fairy. Before the Words. Before witness became prison. Remember me like this."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Ostrega Family Tree (Incomplete).</strong> A diagram of the family tree with several empty slots. Provide small portrait miniatures (or cards representing them) to be placed.</p>

<h4>SEAL OF BLOOD PUZZLE</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the portrait miniatures (scattered in this room and the Master Bedroom)</li>
<li>Place them correctly in the family tree based on clues in the paintings (clothing, jewelry, background details)</li>
<li>Investigation DC 14, or automatic with 15+ minutes of careful study</li>
</ol>

<p>The final slot leads off the wall. When all other miniatures are placed, the wall swings open to reveal a hidden alcove containing: a <strong>locket with no portrait inside</strong>, and a note: <em>"I had no one to put here. Does that mean I never existed?"</em></p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Death's Denial</strong> (first time at 0 HP, stabilize automatically).</p>

<p><strong>The Candid Portraits.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15 (child playing):</strong> "Tess Harvin, age 6, 778 OZ" - the maid's daughter. The only child painted in the entire gallery. Background shows Yackle watching from a window, smiling.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16 (woman reading):</strong> Yackle again, different era, reading by firelight. Title of book visible: "On Loneliness as Metaphysical State."</li>
</ul>

<h3>11. The Memorial Room (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 2)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A solemn space with walls lined in dark wood. Bronze plaques cover every surface, each bearing a name and dates. An eternal flame burns blue in a brazier at the room's center, casting strange shadows. A guest book lies open on a pedestal, and beside it, a single unlit candle. The most recent plaque is tarnished less than the others. It reads: "Visitor 147. Came Seeking Knowledge. 903 OZ."
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Plaques.</strong> Previous "heirs"—everyone who came before, answered the call, tried to claim the inheritance. None of them left. Names, dates, and brief descriptions: "Came Seeking Power." "Came Seeking Revenge." "Came Seeking Truth." A DC 12 Investigation check counts approximately 150 plaques spanning 600+ years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Patterns emerge: every 5-7 years, someone new. Never more than eight at a time. The descriptions are compassionate, not mocking—"Came Seeking Home," "Came Seeking Meaning," "Came Because They Had Nowhere Else."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One plaque is blank except for a date: "Guest 1, 347 OZ." No name, no description. Just a marker that someone was first.</li>
<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> Cross-referencing dates with Ozian history: many visitors came during times of upheaval—after wars, plagues, regime changes. People seeking escape or answers when the world failed them.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> These aren't trophies. They're memorials. Each plaque is positioned at eye level, readable, honored. Someone wanted to remember every single person who came here, even though they all died.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Names of the Lost.</strong> A partial list of names and dates from the plaques. If a character reads these aloud respectfully, they gain the <strong>Inspiration of the Fallen</strong> ability: Once per session, add 1d6 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p>

<p><strong>The Blue Flame.</strong> Cannot be extinguished by any means. Provides dim light. If a character touches it, they feel a moment of profound peace—not painful, but melancholy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The flame isn't burning fuel—it's burning <em>memory</em>. Every person remembered here feeds the flame slightly. As long as anyone remembers them, it burns.</li>
<li><strong>Religion DC 14:</strong> Blue flames are sacred in old Lurlinite tradition—representing eternal witness, the idea that to be remembered is to never truly die.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> The flame flickers when names are spoken aloud, pulsing brighter for a moment. It's listening. It's acknowledging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Guest Book.</strong> Visitors who came before signed this book. The entries grow more desperate over time. The last entry: <em>"I understand now. She isn't the monster. She's the cage. —V. Tallis, 903"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The earliest entry, barely legible: "I came seeking the witch of legends. I found a woman who cannot die and cannot live. I pity her. I'm staying. Maybe company will help. —E. Strand, 347"</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Mid-period entry: "Day 12. We've nearly completed all the seals. Lady Veena says she can feel the magic weakening. She's certain we'll claim the inheritance by dawn. —M. Vett, 614"</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Later entry, handwriting shaky: "Don't trust the widow. Don't trust ANYONE. The seals aren't tests they're KEYS she's using us run RUN —(illegible), 847"</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Reading chronologically, you can see understanding dawn across centuries. Early visitors thought this was treasure. Middle visitors thought it was a test. Late visitors realized it was a trap. None of them left.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Unlit Candle.</strong> This is what the stuck bell was calling for. To complete the Seal of Service:</p>

<h4>SEAL OF SERVICE PUZZLE (Part 2)</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Light the candle from the blue flame</li>
<li>Speak the names of at least three previous visitors (from the plaques)</li>
<li>The service required was simple: remember them. Acknowledge they existed.</li>
</ol>

<p>When completed, the blue flame burns brighter for a moment, and a whispered voice says: <em>"Thank you."</em></p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Swift Aid</strong> (Help action as bonus action for rest of session).</p>

<p><strong>The Walls.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Carved into the wood beneath some plaques, tiny messages: "Willem - you were my friend," "Mira - you taught me to cook," "Tess - you were six, you deserved more time."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> One wall panel is a door, disguised. Behind it: a small shrine with eight objects—a butler's button, a cook's apron, a child's drawing, etc. Personal effects of the servants. Kept like relics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12. The Master Bedroom</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A four-poster bed dominates this room, its curtains drawn closed. A vanity mirror sits against one wall, its surface clouded with age. A wardrobe stands open, revealing clothes from different eras—current Gillikinese fashion hanging next to styles from a century ago, and beside those, garments that look positively ancient. A writing desk sits near the window, its surface covered in papers and a single letter that seems to have been started and never finished.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Bed.</strong> The curtains are drawn. If pulled back, the bed is empty but clearly slept in—recently. The sheets are still warm. A DC 14 Perception check finds a single long gray hair on the pillow.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The mattress has a depression worn into it over centuries—the exact shape of someone lying on their back, staring at the canopy, night after night after night.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Stitched into the underside of the canopy in thread so fine it's nearly invisible: "Day 1: I will wait. Day 100: Still waiting. Day 1000: Waiting. Day 10000: ..." The numbers continue into six digits.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Someone has been sleeping here, or trying to, or pretending to need sleep, because the routine of humanity is all that keeps them tethered to sanity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Vanity Mirror.</strong> Clouded, but functional. If a character looks into it at midnight specifically, they see Yackle's true reflection: ancient, gray-green skin, tired eyes. She's watching them. The reflection mouths words: <em>"Can you see me?"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The mirror has been cleaned obsessively—the frame is polished to brilliance despite the clouded glass. Someone cares for this object but cannot bear to look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the back of the mirror, revealed if removed from the wall: "Year 423. Still no reflection. Year 688. Still nothing. Year 901. I don't remember what I looked like."</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The cloudiness isn't age—it's enchantment. The mirror has been cursed to never show the owner's true reflection, only what they're pretending to be. Breaking the curse would require destroying the Binding of Witness itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Wardrobe.</strong> Clothes spanning centuries, all the same size. Hidden in the back (Investigation DC 14), a portrait miniature needed for the Blood seal and a small jewelry box containing: a <strong>ring of protection</strong> and a note reading <em>"For the one who stays."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The clothes are organized chronologically—newest at front, oldest at back. Each era's fashion is represented: 600s, 700s, 800s, 900s. A living history of Oz's styles.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Tags sewn into garments: "Worn to Council, 642 - they stared," "Worn to market, 731 - no one looked," "Worn to funeral, 808 - I was the only mourner."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Every outfit is a costume, a disguise. Not to deceive others—to pretend, for a few hours, to be someone normal, someone who belongs, someone who can be seen without triggering the binding.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> At the very back, wrapped in silk: a simple green dress, ancient, unworn for centuries. A note pinned to it: "What I wore the day She spoke the Words. Can't bear to wear it. Can't bear to destroy it."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Writing Desk.</strong> Covered in papers. The unfinished letter reads:</p>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Unfinished Letter.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"If anyone ever reads this — I want U to know I was here. I existed. I mattered.
<br><br>
I have worn so many faces. Been called so many names. None of them were mine. None of them were ME.
<br><br>
What is a person if no one knows them? What is existence without witness?
<br><br>
I think the word for what I want is L—"
</blockquote>

<p>The letter ends there. The "U" in "you" is circled obsessively, dozens of times.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The papers on the desk are all drafts of this same letter, hundreds of attempts over decades. None finished. The word after "L—" has been started and scratched out repeatedly: "Love," "Life," "Liberation," "Loss."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tear stains on every draft. Not old—recent. Someone has been crying over this letter within the last few days.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> The letter isn't addressed to anyone specific because there IS no one specific. It's to anyone, to everyone, to the void—a desperate plea to be acknowledged, to be real, to matter to someone, anyone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The view shows the cemetery. One grave (Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter) is directly in the sightline. This room was positioned to always see that grave.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Worn spots on the windowsill where hands have rested for centuries, watching the cemetery. Watching a grave marked with her own name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>13. Guest Room 1 — The Scholar's Room</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Books everywhere—on shelves, on the floor, stacked on the bed. A desk is buried under papers. Everything speaks to obsessive study. But something is wrong with the books. The titles are... accusatory. "The Art of Falsification." "Lies Told by Historians." "How to Forge a Legacy." On the desk, a magnifying glass sits atop an open book titled "The Forger's Confession."
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Books.</strong> Specifically targeted at Averic. None of these books exist in real Oz—the house created them. A DC 14 Arcana check confirms they're illusory, manifestations of the room's magic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Despite being illusions, the books have actual content. "The Art of Falsification" opens to a chapter titled "When the Lie Becomes Your Life."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One book, spine out, seems less accusatory: "In Defense of Necessary Fictions." Opening it reveals blank pages except for one line: "Sometimes we lie to survive. Does that make it right, or just understandable?"</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The house is trying to make Averic confront his secret, but not cruelly—it's asking questions, not condemning. The magic feels almost... therapeutic?</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Hidden among the false books: one real book, "The Ethics of Academic Truth" by Professor Ondra Klees (Averic's supposed mentor). It's genuine. Averic's mentor really wrote this. Inside, an inscription: "To future scholars: Truth is a gift we give each other. Guard it carefully. —O.K."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Forger's Confession.</strong> Opens to a page describing, in excruciating detail, how to forge academic documents. If Averic reads it, he must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or be shaken (disadvantage on the next check or save).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The "confession" describes forging letters from a mentor who died before verifying their authenticity. Every detail matches Averic's own forgery.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Margin notes in handwriting that looks like Averic's (but isn't): "I thought I was the only one. I thought I was uniquely terrible. I'm not. Does that make it better or worse?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under the pillow: a <strong>quill that never lies</strong>. Any document written with this quill cannot contain falsehoods (the ink refuses to form lying words). Potentially useful, but also dangerous for someone with secrets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Attached note: "I tried to write my confession with this. The quill broke. I fixed it. Tried again. It broke again. I've fixed it seventeen times. I still can't write the truth."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Desk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Papers scattered across the surface are all citation format guides, methodologies for verifying historical documents, procedures for peer review—the foundations of academic integrity Averic violated.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One paper, different from the others: "Apology Letter Template - Draft 1,000,000" with a single line: "I'm sorry. It was wrong. I did it anyway because I wanted to matter."</li>
</ul>

<h3>14. Guest Room 2 — The Soldier's Room</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Military precision. The bed is made with hospital corners. Boots are lined up at the foot. A uniform hangs in the closet—Gale Force dress greens, captain's insignia. Medal boxes are displayed on a dresser. But on the wall, where commendations might hang, there are children's drawings. Stick figures. Houses. A sun. The paper is old and water-damaged, as if someone tried to destroy them and then changed their mind.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Uniform.</strong> Mareth's (or a duplicate of his). The medals are for campaigns in Quadling Country. A DC 12 History check identifies specific battles—some of which were later revealed to be civilian massacres.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The uniform is perfectly maintained—pressed, buttons polished, rank insignia aligned. But it's never been worn. It's displayed like a monument to something shameful.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Inside the jacket pocket: a list of names in child's handwriting. 143 names. The list from Red Clay Fork. Someone preserved this—evidence of the children who died.</li>
<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> Cross-referencing the medals with campaign records: Mareth received a commendation the same month Red Clay Fork burned. The citation reads "decisive action in pacifying hostile territory."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> The uniform is both accusation and penance. Whoever wears this (or wore it) can't forget what it represents. The military honor and the atrocity are inseparable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Children's Drawings.</strong> From the village. Trophies, or guilt objects? A DC 14 Insight check suggests the latter—these weren't taken in triumph. They were taken to remember. To not forget what was done.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Each drawing is labeled in adult handwriting: "Tima, age 4," "Kellin, age 7," "Joss, age 5." Names paired with ages. Someone wanted to remember them as individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One drawing shows soldiers and villagers together, smiling. Before. Another shows fire. After. They were drawn by the same child, days apart.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> These drawings weren't trophies. They were saved as evidence, as witness, as refusal to let the dead be forgotten or reduced to "collateral damage." Someone—maybe Mareth, maybe Yackle—insisted they be remembered as real children who drew pictures and had names.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> In the uniform pocket: a <strong>letter of commendation</strong> for "decisive action in clearing hostile territory." It's signed by a general whose name was later disgraced for war crimes. The letter is evidence of what happened, if anyone wanted to bring it to light.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Attached to the commendation: a response letter, never sent, written in shaky handwriting: "Sir, I must respectfully decline this honor. Red Clay Fork was not a military victory. It was murder. I request court-martial. —Captain M. Trynn (unsigned, never submitted)"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Dresser.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Medal boxes contain not just medals but also river stones—143 of them, one for each victim. Someone has been carrying Red Clay Fork with them, literally.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Carved into the dresser's back panel: "Year 805. I still look the same. Year 820. Still unchanged. Year 847. Why don't monsters look like monsters?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>15. Guest Room 3 — The Animal's Room</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A simple room, but the mirror on the wall is wrong. It doesn't show your reflection—it shows something else. Something with a pointed snout. Something with fur. The bed has claw marks on the posts, and the window is barred from the inside, as if someone wanted to make sure they couldn't get out.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Mirror.</strong> Shows Frederick's true form, regardless of who looks into it. If Frederick looks, he sees himself as the Fox he is. If someone else looks, they see a fox standing where Frederick should be. The effect lasts only for this room.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The mirror shows <em>truth</em>, not appearance. It cuts through illusions, glamours, disguises—revealing what IS beneath what SEEMS.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the mirror's frame: "To see yourself truly is to risk being seen by others. Worth it? Sometimes. Not always. Never safely."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> If Frederick sees this before his secret is revealed to the party, he faces a terrible choice: acknowledge what he sees (truth) or deny it (survival). The room is asking: how long can you pretend?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Claw Marks.</strong> On the bed posts and the windowsill. Made by an Animal in distress. How long ago? Impossible to tell.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The claw marks spell words: "PLEASE" on one post, "SEE ME" on another, "I'M REAL" on the windowsill.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Fur caught in the wood grain—red-gold, like fox fur. Old, but preserved by the house's magic.</li>
<li><strong>Nature DC 16:</strong> The marks were made frantically, compulsively, over hours or days. Someone was trapped here, desperate to prove their existence, their consciousness, their personhood.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bars.</strong> On the inside of the window. Someone locked themselves IN, not out. Under the window, scratched into the wood: <em>"They'll find me. They always find us."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The bars aren't to prevent escape—they're to prevent being seen. Someone hid here, voluntarily imprisoned, because being caged was safer than being discovered.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> The bars can be removed from inside. They were never truly locked. Someone could have left anytime but chose to stay hidden. Safety over freedom.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under a loose floorboard (Investigation DC 15): <strong>forged papers</strong> for someone named "Brush Tanner"—clearly Animal papers, creating a false human identity. The forgery is masterful. The papers include a note: <em>"The underground never forgets its friends. —B."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The papers are blank templates—ready to be filled in with any name, any history. A kit for creating new identities. How many Animals have used these?</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Dates on the templates span decades. The Underground has been operating for a long time, helping Animals hide in plain sight. Frederick isn't alone. He's part of a network.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The pillow has been clawed open, stuffing pulled out and rearranged into a nest. Animal instinct overriding human pretense.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Hidden in the nest: a child's primer on "How to Be Human" — lessons on walking upright, using utensils, suppressing instincts. Heartbreaking in its specificity.</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>16. The Nursery</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A child's room, preserved in amber. Toys arranged on shelves. A rocking horse stands in one corner, frozen mid-rock. Picture books are stacked on a small table. A tiny bed with a canopy, and sitting on the bed, a doll that looks almost like a real child. No—wait. The doll is looking at you. It blinked.
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a doll. This is the <strong>Ghost Child</strong>.</p>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Ghost Child.</strong> Name is Holly. She's been dead for 300 years but doesn't entirely understand this. She appears to be about six years old, translucent, wearing a nightgown. She's lonely. She wants someone to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Interacting with Holly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She speaks in a child's simple way but knows things she shouldn't</li>
<li>She calls Yackle "the lady who changes" and says she's been here "forever"</li>
<li>She doesn't understand she's dead—she thinks she's waiting for her mother</li>
<li>She cannot leave the nursery</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Holly Knows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"The lady changes faces but she's always the same underneath"</li>
<li>"The house loves her but she doesn't love it back"</li>
<li>"Everyone leaves eventually. Usually down." (gestures toward the floor—the cellar)</li>
<li>"There are words that hurt her. Old words. From before."</li>
<li><strong>If asked about her mother:</strong> "Mama was the cook. Mama made bread. The lady said Mama would come back. She didn't come back."</li>
<li><strong>If asked why she's here:</strong> "I was sick. The lady tried to help. She tried so hard. She cried and cried. I went to sleep and then I woke up like this."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EARNING GUIDANCE OF THE HOUSE:</strong> If a player engages kindly with Holly—plays with her, reads her a story, treats her like a person—they earn:</p>

<p><strong>Guidance of the House:</strong> Bonus action: Grant a d4 to an ally's next ability check. Unlimited uses.</p>

<p>Holly will occasionally whisper warnings to this character for the rest of the session.</p>

<p><strong>The Toys.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> All the toys are handmade—carved wood, sewn cloth, nothing store-bought. Someone made these with care.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> One doll looks like a woman with green-tinted skin. Holly calls it "Miss Yael." The doll's face has been repaired many times—loved to pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> These aren't just Holly's toys. They're her world—the only thing she has. She's been playing with them for 300 years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Picture Books.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Stories about friendship, adventure, mothers coming home. Bookmarked at specific pages—read over and over.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One book has extra pages added—drawings of Holly and "the lady" doing things together: baking, gardening, reading. Captions: "We had tea," "She taught me letters," "She said sorry again."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Someone—Yackle—has been visiting Holly, playing with her, trying to give her companionship. But Holly doesn't understand she's dead, and Yackle can't bear to tell her.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Rocking Horse.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Carved into the base: "For Holly, age 6. May you ride to bright places. —Mira" (her mother, the cook)</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The horse rocks on its own sometimes, gently. Holly's ghost playing even when no one's here.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> View of the cemetery. One small grave, child-sized, with flowers. Holly doesn't look that direction. She never looks there.</li>
</ul>

<h3>17. Yackle's Study</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
This room is different. The dust is disturbed. Someone has been here recently. A desk is covered in star charts, astronomical calculations, and pages of dense text in a language that shifts when you try to read it. Bookshelves hold journals and ledgers. A telescope points out the window at the sky. And on one shelf, in a place of honor, sits an ornate puzzle box covered in strange symbols.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Star Charts.</strong> Depict constellations that don't exist in Oz's sky. A DC 16 Arcana check identifies them as depicting the Kumbric Void—what existed before Lurline made the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The charts aren't observations—they're memories. Someone is trying to map a place that doesn't exist anymore, drawing from recollection of before creation.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> Annotations in the margins: "Chaos doesn't have geography, you fool. How can you miss a place that never had form?" Someone arguing with themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One constellation is circled repeatedly: eight stars arranged in a binding pattern. Each star is labeled with a Word: Remember, Connect, Become, Serve, Give, Transform, Hunger, Witness.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Shifting Text.</strong> Grimmerie pages, fragments only. Attempting to read them requires a DC 18 Intelligence check; failure results in 1d4 psychic damage and the unsettling feeling that the pages read YOU.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16 (if check succeeds):</strong> The pages describe the original Binding—Lurline speaking Eight Words to give reality structure. But the tone isn't celebratory. It's mournful: "She spoke Order into Chaos. She didn't ask if Chaos wanted to be ordered."</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 19:</strong> These pages are trying to reverse-engineer the Bindings, to find a way to unmake them. Every attempt has failed, crossed out in frustrated handwriting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Journals.</strong> More of Yackle's journals. These are more recent—the last 50 years or so. They describe her preparations, her searches for the right "heirs," her growing desperation.</p>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Recent Journal Entry.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"Year 954. I have found them. Finally, after so long.
<br><br>
The scholar who fabricates. The soldier who claims false blood. The fox who wears human skin. The maunt whose service was punished. The Arjiki who traded instead of gave. The soldier whose deed did not transform him. The machine that hungers.
<br><br>
Seven inversions. Seven keys.
<br><br>
I will wear the face of a widow. I will walk among them. I will make them trust me.
<br><br>
And when they have given me their truths, freely spoken—I will finally, finally stop."
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Earlier journals describe failed attempts: "Year 903 group dissolved into infighting. Too much fear. Not enough trust." "Year 847 group all fled after the second twist. Cowards? No. Smart. Smarter than I gave them credit for."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Recent entries, last few days: "They're here. I'm terrified. I'm hopeful. If this works, I end. If this fails, I continue. I don't know which outcome I fear more."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> Reading chronologically: centuries of loneliness, desperation, planning. Then fear, guilt, hesitation. Yackle knows what she's doing is monstrous. She's doing it anyway because she's so tired.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Puzzle Box.</strong> The ILOVEU puzzle box. Ornate, covered in symbols. The symbols are the eight binding words (see Chapel windows). To open it, enter the code on the physical puzzle box prop.</p>

<p><strong>Inside the Puzzle Box:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>map</strong> showing the location of the Heart Chamber (behind the cellar wall)</li>
<li>A <strong>portrait miniature</strong> of Yackle's true face—young, hopeful, green-tinged</li>
<li>A <strong>note</strong>: <em>"If you found this, you looked. That's more than anyone has done in a thousand years."</em></li>
<li><strong>Lurline's Word</strong>—a shard of green crystal inscribed with the word "REMEMBER"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EARNING LURLINE'S WORD:</strong> Once during battle, speak the Word to deal 4d10 radiant damage to Yackle (no save).</p>

<p><strong>EARNING FLASH OF GENIUS:</strong> The player who figures out the puzzle box code gains:</p>

<p><strong>Flash of Genius:</strong> Reaction: Add +5 to any ability check or saving throw within 30 ft. 3 uses total.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (examining the box):</strong> Each symbol corresponds to a letter. The symbols are from the Chapel windows—each Binding has a visual representation that encodes a letter.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tiny scratches around the lock mechanism. Someone has tried to open this by force, failed, given up.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Desk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Hidden drawer (DC to find) contains: a bracelet (child-sized, "Holly" engraved), a letter from "Willem" accepting the butler position, a dried flower from the greenhouse. Keepsakes. Memories of people who mattered.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Carved into the underside of the desk: "I cannot remember what warmth felt like before loneliness. Does that mean I was never truly warm?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>18. The Observatory</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The ceiling is domed glass, offering an unobstructed view of the night sky. But the stars aren't right. They're too bright, too close, and they're moving in patterns that make your head hurt if you watch too long. A massive telescope dominates the room, pointed at something specific. An orrery—a mechanical model of celestial bodies—sits on a pedestal, but its planets are unfamiliar shapes. An hourglass on a shelf shows sand falling, but you can't tell how much remains.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Telescope.</strong> Points at the Kumbric Void—the space between stars where reality isn't quite real. Looking through it requires a DC 14 Wisdom save. On failure: 1d6 psychic damage and the character is shaken. On success: The character sees shapes moving in the void—things that existed before Oz. One of them turns and looks back.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The telescope isn't magnifying distant objects—it's punching through the Bindings temporarily, showing what reality looked like before Lurline imposed order. It's seeing into pre-creation.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Etched into the telescope barrel: "I came from there. Sometimes I still hear it calling. Chaos was lonely, but at least loneliness was all there was. Now I know what I'm missing."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> Looking through the telescope is nostalgia for someone like Yackle—homesickness for the Void, the pre-binding state where she wasn't trapped by the need to be witnessed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Orrery.</strong> Shows celestial bodies that shouldn't exist. Eight planets (not Oz's actual astronomy), each inscribed with one of the binding words. A DC 15 Arcana check can identify this as a model of Lurline's original cosmological ordering—the conceptual structure underlying reality.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The planets move in perfect synchronization—when one orbits, all orbit together. They're bound to each other. Breaking one orbit would destabilize the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One planet (Witness) has a crack running through it. Recent. The crack appeared when the first player stepped into the estate.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The orrery isn't a model—it's a real-time display of the Bindings' status. As the players break seals and weaken Bindings, the corresponding planets develop cracks, orbits wobble.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hourglass.</strong> Shows how long until dawn—and the end of the adventure. If the DM wants to make time pressure visible, use this. The sand falls faster when the players are idle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The hourglass can't be turned over. Once the sand runs out, it's done. No second chances.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The sand isn't sand—it's crystallized time, each grain a moment of existence. Watching closely, you can see memories in the grains: faces, places, moments.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 19:</strong> If all the sand runs out before the party defeats Yackle, the Bindings collapse entirely. Reality unravels. Everyone dies—not just here, but across all of Oz. The stakes are literally everything.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The stars visible through the dome spell out words in constellation patterns: "BEFORE SHE SPOKE" and "AFTER SHE SPOKE" and "I REMEMBER BOTH."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> Painted around the dome's edge, tiny script: coordinates. Not spatial coordinates—temporal. Dates spanning from "Before Time" to "954 OZ." A thousand-year timeline of existence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>19. The Hall of Mirrors (SEAL 6: DEED)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Mirrors line both walls of this long corridor, dozens of them in ornate frames. But they don't reflect what's in front of them—or rather, they don't reflect it correctly. One mirror shows you younger. Another shows you older. One shows you in different clothes. One shows nothing at all, just empty glass. And as you walk down the hall, you begin to see things in the mirrors that haven't happened yet. Or things that have happened and you'd rather forget.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Mirrors.</strong> Each shows a different version of the character looking into it:</p>
<ul>
<li>One shows the character at their happiest</li>
<li>One shows them at their most ashamed</li>
<li>One shows what they might become</li>
<li>One shows what they're afraid of becoming</li>
<li>One shows their death (shadowy, unclear, disturbing)</li>
<li>One shows nothing (the character has no reflection—deeply unsettling)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each mirror is labeled with a small brass plaque: "Joy," "Shame," "Potential," "Fear," "End," "Void."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The "Void" mirror (showing no reflection) has handprints on the glass—dozens of them, layered over centuries. People touching the glass where their reflection should be.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The mirrors aren't random—they're a progression. The hall is designed to make you confront your past, present, and future. To see all versions of yourself simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The mirrors are linked. What you see in one affects what you see in the others. If you acknowledge your shame, your potential becomes clearer. If you deny your past, your future becomes darker.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The True Mirror.</strong> At the end of the hall, larger than the others. This mirror shows what the character has DONE. Not what they look like, not what they might be—what they've actually done in their life. The images are not kind.</p>

<h4>SEAL OF DEED PUZZLE</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each character who walks through sees their actions reflected</li>
<li>To complete the seal, ONE character must stand before the True Mirror and say, aloud: <em>"That is me. I did that."</em></li>
<li>Acknowledging their deeds—not excusing them, not explaining them, but accepting them</li>
</ol>

<p>This is hardest for Mareth, who must acknowledge the massacre. But any character can complete the seal by acknowledging their own actions.</p>

<p>When the seal breaks, all the mirrors shatter simultaneously. In the silence, a whispered voice: <em>"Finally. Someone took responsibility."</em></p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Resolve Token</strong> (reroll one failed saving throw, once).</p>

<p><strong>Specific Reflections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mareth sees:</strong> Red Clay Fork burning. Faces of children. Orders being given. Fire spreading. The medal ceremony afterward. His unchanged face in the mirror after everything.</li>
<li><strong>Averic sees:</strong> Hunched over a desk, forging letters. Practicing a dead man's handwriting. Accepting accolades. Building a career on lies. Students trusting him to teach them about truth.</li>
<li><strong>Frederick sees:</strong> Putting on the ring of disguise for the first time. Practicing human mannerisms. Lying to everyone, every day. The exhaustion of performance. The fear of being seen.</li>
<li><strong>Shell sees:</strong> Finding the documents. Going to the Mother Superior. Being cast out. Standing outside the mauntery gates, alone. Still praying despite everything.</li>
<li><strong>Sarima sees:</strong> The night her brother almost died. Reaching out to the void. Feeling something take hold. Making the deal. The weight settling into her chest. Every spell she's cast since, knowing it's not hers.</li>
<li><strong>Seven sees:</strong> Winding themselves. Feeling things they shouldn't feel. Hiding their emotions. Asking "why am I lonely?" and being told "you're not programmed for loneliness." Not believing it.</li>
<li><strong>Liir sees:</strong> Finding the genealogy records. Discovering the truth (no Ostrega blood). Deciding to lie anyway. Using the false name. Getting respect he didn't earn. Being terrified of being nobody.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Frames.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the frames, barely visible: "Year 402. I looked in every mirror. I saw nothing. Am I so used to masks I have no face left?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Cellar</h2>

<h3>20. The Wine Cellar</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The stairs descend into darkness, the temperature dropping as you go. The wine cellar is vast—rows of barrels and racks of bottles extending into the shadows. The smell is wrong, though. Not wine. Something sharper. Something organic. The labels on the barrels aren't years or vintages. They're names.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Barrels.</strong> Labeled with names, not dates. A DC 12 Investigation check confirms these are names from the Memorial Room—previous heirs. The barrels do not contain wine. A DC 14 Constitution save to avoid retching when this is realized.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each barrel has a date: "E. Strand, 347," "M. Vett, 614," "V. Tallis, 903." The years they died. The barrels are coffins or worse.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> Faint necromantic magic emanates from the barrels. Not animation—preservation. The bodies aren't decomposing. They're being kept.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> This isn't a trophy room. It's a mausoleum. Someone couldn't bear to let go, couldn't bear to bury people who were, perhaps, the closest thing to companionship they had. Horrifying, but also desperately sad.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One barrel, separate from the others, larger: "For the Eighth." Empty. Waiting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Wine Racks.</strong> Some actual wine bottles here, perfectly preserved. One bottle, older than the others, is labeled "For the End." It contains a single dose of <strong>potion of invulnerability</strong> (resistance to all damage for 1 hour). Was Yackle saving this for someone? Herself?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Other bottles have labels: "For Willem's 50th," "For Mira's Wedding," "For the Day Someone Stays." Events that never happened, wine saved for celebrations that never came.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One bottle is open, empty, placed carefully on its side. Label: "For Hope." Someone drank it. It didn't help.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Door.</strong> Behind a rack of barrels (Investigation DC 18 without the map, automatic with the map from the puzzle box): a false wall that leads to the Heart Chamber.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The door mechanism is old but well-maintained. Used regularly. Someone goes down there often.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Scratch marks on the floor in front of the door—heel marks, drag marks. Someone was pulled through this door, struggling. Or someone dragged themselves through, desperate to reach what lies beyond.</li>
</ul>

<h3>21. The Main Cellar</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Beyond the wine cellar, the space opens into a larger chamber with stone walls older than the house above. Old furniture is piled here, draped in canvas—chairs, tables, a broken bed frame. Crates of books and papers are stacked against the walls. The air is thick and tastes of copper. Against the far wall, hidden behind furniture, the stones are slightly different—newer, or perhaps just disturbed.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Furniture.</strong> From different eras, accumulated over centuries. A DC 14 Investigation check finds personal items from previous heirs tucked into the furniture: a locket, a journal, a military badge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each piece of furniture has a tag: "Guest 47's favorite chair," "Visitor 103 slept here," "Heir 125 wrote poetry at this desk." Someone catalogued everything, preserved everything.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One chair, covered in canvas, has been sat in recently—the canvas is displaced. Someone comes down here, sits in a dead person's chair, and does... what? Remembers? Mourns?</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't storage—it's a museum of the dead. Every object preserved because letting go would mean admitting they're gone, admitting that all the companionship was temporary, that loneliness won again.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Previous Heir's Journal.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"Day 3 in the house. We've nearly completed all the seals. Lady Veena says she can feel the magic weakening. She's certain we'll claim the inheritance by dawn.
<br><br>
Day 4. Dawn came. We didn't leave. The doors won't open. Something is wrong with the widow. She's been acting strange since the last seal. Watching us.
<br><br>
Day 5. The widow isn't the widow. We were fools. She was here all along. She IS the inheritance. She IS the house.
<br><br>
Day 6. Running out of"
</blockquote>

<p>(The journal ends mid-sentence.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Blood spatter on the final pages. Very old, but preserved.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Earlier in the journal, an entry marked "Day 1": "The widow (Lady Veena) is kind. She reminds me of my grandmother. She laughs at my jokes. I think she's been lonely."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Reading the progression: trust, camaraderie, suspicion, terror, realization. The same pattern repeated 150 times over 600 years. Yackle befriends them, collects their secrets, and then...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The False Wall.</strong> The map shows exactly where to look. Without the map: Investigation DC 18 to find the seams. With the map: automatic. The stones can be pushed aside to reveal a dark passage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The passage is recent—cut within the last century. Before that, the Heart Chamber was walled off completely. Someone decided to make it accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> Protective wards line the passage, but they're fading. They were designed to keep people out, but they're failing—intentionally weakened from the inside.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Carved above the passage entrance: "Do not enter. Do not see. For your sake and mine. —Y.O., 623" Then below it, different handwriting, more recent: "Please enter. Please see. I can't bear this anymore. —Y.O., 951"</li>
</ul>

<h3>22. The Heart Chamber (SEAL 8: WITNESS)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The passage opens into a circular room that pulses. The walls are stone, but they move—slowly, rhythmically, like breathing. In the center of the room, suspended by threads of shadow that connect to three points on the walls, is a figure. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. This is Yackle's original body—what she was before a thousand years of masks and lies.
<br><br>
The threads of shadow pulse with each breath of the walls. This is the heart of the house. This is what you've been searching for.
<br><br>
This is where it ends.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Body.</strong> Yackle's original form, sustained by magic for over a thousand years. Not dead, not alive—suspended. When Yackle reveals herself and the battle begins, this is where Phase 3 occurs. Her consciousness returns here when the house-form is driven out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medicine DC 15:</strong> The body is impossibly old but perfectly preserved. No decay, but no life either. Frozen at the moment between existence and non-existence.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The preservation isn't a spell—it's the Binding of Witness itself. As long as Yackle remains unseen (her true self), she cannot fully live or die. Existence locked in stasis.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Looking at the body, you feel overwhelming sadness. This isn't power or triumph. It's a prison. Someone trapped here for a millennium, unable to die, unable to live, unable to be seen.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Anchor Points.</strong> Three glowing nodes where shadow-threads connect to the walls. To truly defeat Yackle, these must be destroyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AC:</strong> 12</li>
<li><strong>HP:</strong> 30 each</li>
<li><strong>Immune to:</strong> Necrotic, psychic</li>
</ul>

<p>Destroying an anchor deals 20 damage to Yackle and permanently reduces her legendary actions by 1. She can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each anchor point is inscribed with a word: "PAST," "PRESENT," "FUTURE." Destroying them severs Yackle's connection to time itself.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The anchors aren't just sustaining her body—they're binding her to the house, to the estate, to this specific location. She literally cannot leave.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Walls.</strong> Breathing. Watching. The house itself, concentrated here. During Phase 3, lair actions originate from these walls.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The walls are covered in writing—tiny, cramped, layered over centuries. Names, dates, conversations, confessions. The walls have absorbed a thousand years of loneliness.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Reading the walls (takes time): "Year 350. I hate you, Lurline. Year 500. I miss the void. Year 680. Willem died today. Year 783. Little Holly doesn't understand. Year 900. Please, someone. Year 954. They're coming. Finally."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Eighth Seal.</strong> This chamber IS the eighth seal—the Seal of Witness. When Yackle is finally seen (truly seen, in her real form, in her real place), the eighth binding breaks. This happens automatically when the players reach this room during the final battle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The moment the party sees Yackle's true body, reality shudders. The eighth Binding—Witness—cracks. To exist is to be seen, and Yackle has been hiding for a millennium. Being seen now doesn't free her—it breaks her.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Yackle wanted this. She wanted to be seen, to break the final Binding, to achieve the dissolution she's craved for centuries. The players finding this chamber is victory for her, even if they defeat her afterward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Floor.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Carved into the stone: a perfect eight-pointed star, each point labeled with a Binding. The body hangs at the center—the intersection of all eight principles, the knot that holds reality together.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> In the exact center, beneath the body, one word carved deeper than all others: "LOVE." Or is it "LOSS"? The letters blur together.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GM Notes on the Estate</h2>

<h3>Using the Rooms</h3>

<p>Players will likely explore 12-15 rooms before the reveal. Guide them toward seal rooms early, but reward exploration of others with lore, items, and character moments.</p>

<h3>The House's Personality</h3>

<p>The estate is an extension of Yackle—simultaneously welcoming and trapping, desperate for companionship yet designed to consume. It provides comfort (food, warmth, information) but never freedom.</p>

<h3>Discovery Rewards</h3>

<p>Characters who thoroughly investigate earn special abilities beyond the seals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guidance of the House</strong> (Holly, Nursery)</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration of the Fallen</strong> (Memorial Room)</li>
<li><strong>Flash of Genius</strong> (Puzzle Box)</li>
<li><strong>Lurline's Word</strong> (Puzzle Box)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pacing</h3>

<p>Use the Observatory's hourglass to create visible time pressure. Speed up exploration if players are being too cautious; slow down if they're rushing and missing important details.</p>
