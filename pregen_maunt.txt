<h1>Pre-Generated Character: The Former Maunt</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"I gave ten years to the Unnamed God. Now I'm taking them back."</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This character escaped from a <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('factions/mauntery-system', 'Mauntery'); return false;">mauntery</a> (Unionist convent) and carries both divine power and deep trauma. She can recognize religious symbols, resist magical compulsion, and sense sacred/profane energies. However, her past makes her vulnerable to psychological manipulation, and she struggles with guilt over abandoning her vows. Yackle may have connections to the mauntery she fled.</p>

<h2>Class Features (Unionist - Conversion Domain)</h2>

<h3>Divine Domain: Conversion</h3>
<p>Shell was trained to spread Unionist doctrine and convert the faithless. Though she's left the church, the divine power remains—the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'Unnamed God'); return false;">Unnamed God</a> either hasn't noticed her defection, or doesn't care.</p>

<h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Persuasion and Performance (from Conversion Domain)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compelling Presence (1st level feature)</h3>
<p>Add Wisdom modifier (+3) to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Also knows the <em>friends</em> cantrip (not used—she finds it manipulative and refuses to cast it).</p>

<h3>Channel Divinity (2/rest)</h3>
<p>Shell can use Channel Divinity twice between rests (recovers on short or long rest).</p>

<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Heretics</h4>
<p>As an action, present holy symbol and force heretical spellcasters (<a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-lurlinite', 'Lurlinites'); return false;">Lurlinites</a>, <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/classes/the-witch', 'Witches'); return false;">Witches</a>, etc.) within 30 ft. to make Wisdom save (DC 14) or be turned for 1 minute.</p>

<h4>Channel Divinity: Convert the Masses</h4>
<p>As an action, deliver a sermon. Each creature of your choice within 30 ft. that can hear you makes Wisdom save (DC 14) or is charmed for 1 hour (or until you/allies harm them). Charmed creatures view Unionism favorably and listen to religious arguments.</p>

<p><em>Shell rarely uses this ability anymore. It reminds her too much of the mauntery.</em></p>

<h3>Shepherd of Souls (6th level feature)</h3>
<p>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points, the target also gains temporary hit points equal to 2 + spell level.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scale mail armor (worn under civilian clothes)</li>
<li>Light wooden shield</li>
<li>Mace (simple, functional)</li>
<li>Holy symbol (Unionist Eye—she keeps it wrapped in cloth, conflicted about carrying it)</li>
<li>Prayer book (pages torn out, heavily annotated with doubts and questions)</li>
<li>Healer's kit</li>
<li>Traveler's clothes (plain, practical)</li>
<li>Mauntery robes (packed away, can't bring herself to discard them)</li>
<li>Small wooden carving of a bird (gift from another escapee)</li>
<li>25 gp (saved carefully)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background Feature: Sacred Sanctuary</h2>

<p>You know how to find and navigate <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('factions/mauntery-system', 'mauntery'); return false;">maunteries</a>, churches, and Unionist safe houses. Many religious communities will offer you shelter, food, and basic supplies—though you must be careful, as some might try to "rescue" you back into religious life. You also know Unionist codes, rituals, and internal politics that outsiders never see.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm most comfortable when caring for others—healing, cooking, mending. Idle hands make me anxious.</li>
<li>I speak quietly and choose my words carefully, like I'm still afraid of being overheard by the Mother Superior.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ideal</h3>
<p><strong>Compassion.</strong> The divine should comfort the suffering, not enforce obedience through fear. (Good)</p>

<h3>Bond</h3>
<p>I left three other women behind when I escaped the mauntery. I think about them every day and wonder if they're still alive.</p>

<h3>Flaw</h3>
<p>I second-guess every decision, terrified I'm making the wrong choice. Ten years of having no choices will do that.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>Oona Mosswell was seventeen when her family gave her to the mauntery. Not sold, they insisted—dedicated to holy service. It was an honor. She would serve the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('religion/unionist-god', 'Unnamed God'); return false;">Unnamed God</a> and pray for her family's souls.</p>

<p>The <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/locations/st-prowd-mauntery', 'St. Prowd\'s Mauntery'); return false;">St. Prowd's Mauntery</a> was cold stone walls, endless prayer, and silence. The sisters were kind, in their way—kind like jailers can be kind. Oona became Sister Shell (named for humility, for emptiness, for being a vessel the divine could fill). She learned to heal, to pray, to convert the wayward.</p>

<p>She was good at it. Too good. She could calm rioting crowds with a sermon, convince doubters with a gentle word. The Mother Superior called her blessed. Sister Shell called it something else: manipulation.</p>

<p>At twenty-seven, after ten years of walls and prayers and swallowing her doubts, Sister Shell walked away. She didn't plan it. One morning she was sent to the market for supplies, and she just... kept walking. She walked for three days before she believed she'd really done it.</p>

<p>The guilt followed her. She'd abandoned her vows, her sisters, her god. But she'd also chosen herself for the first time in a decade. She used her healing skills to survive, moving from town to town, never staying long.</p>

<p>The inheritance letter found her in a village in <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/gillikin', 'Gillikin'); return false;">Gillikin</a>. An aunt she'd never heard of—Yackle—had named her in a will. Sister Shell suspected a trap (the church hunting her down?), but she also needed the money. And maybe, just maybe, she was tired of running.</p>

<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>

<p>Sister Shell has no memory of anyone named Yackle in her family. Her parents never mentioned such a relative. This should be a warning sign.</p>

<p><strong>What Shell Doesn't Know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yackle has connections to various maunteries and may have arranged Shell's "donation" to St. Prowd's years ago</li>
<li>Yackle is interested in Shell because she wields divine power while actively doubting her god—a fascinating paradox</li>
<li>The fact that Shell can still cast Unionist spells despite abandoning the faith suggests something unusual about the source of her power</li>
<li>Yackle might have been watching Shell for years, waiting for her to escape</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Shell Might Discover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Records in the manor showing Yackle's financial donations to St. Prowd's Mauntery</li>
<li>A letter from the Mother Superior to Yackle, discussing "the Shell girl's promising progress"</li>
<li>Evidence that Yackle collects people who've escaped religious life—either to help them or exploit them</li>
<li>Yackle's own complicated relationship with the divine (she's ancient, she's seen gods rise and fall)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Shell</h2>

<h3>Mannerisms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clasps hands in prayer position when thinking, then catches herself and stops</li>
<li>Speaks in a soft, measured voice—trained to be soothing and authoritative</li>
<li>Flinches at sudden loud noises or raised voices</li>
<li>Automatically begins to tend to injured people or clean up messes (caretaker instinct)</li>
<li>Wraps and unwraps the cloth around her holy symbol when nervous</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voice and Speech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Calm, gentle tone even under stress (mauntery training)</li>
<li>Uses religious language out of habit, then corrects herself: "The Unnamed God willing—I mean, hopefully..."</li>
<li>Apologizes frequently, even for things that aren't her fault</li>
<li>When comforting others, slips into formal sermon cadence before catching herself</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Understand why "Aunt Yackle" has named her as an heir</li>
<li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Earn enough money to disappear properly, maybe start a new life somewhere the church won't find her</li>
<li><strong>Hidden:</strong> Prove to herself that leaving was the right choice, that she can survive outside the mauntery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Tips</h2>

<h3>Playing Shell Effectively</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Healer:</strong> You're support. Keep allies alive with <em>cure wounds</em>, use <em>spiritual weapon</em> for consistent damage, buff with <em>shield of faith</em> and <em>beacon of hope</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict About Power:</strong> You left the church, but the divine power remains. Every spell you cast is a reminder of what you've abandoned—and proof that maybe the god doesn't care about your vows as much as the church claimed.</li>
<li><strong>Gentle Authority:</strong> You were trained to lead, persuade, and comfort. You can take charge in social situations, but you're conflicted about using those skills (they feel manipulative).</li>
<li><strong>Trauma Responses:</strong> Roleplay the psychological impact of ten years in an restrictive religious institution. You struggle with decision-making, flinch at authority, and are deeply conflict-averse.</li>
<li><strong>Moral Compass:</strong> Despite everything, you believe in compassion, healing, and helping others. That's not the church talking—that's you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recognize religious symbols: "That prayer book—that's a mauntery copy. How did Yackle get this?"</li>
<li>React to coercion: "I won't be forced. Not again. If you want my help, ask."</li>
<li>Offer healing after combat: "Hold still. This will help." (gentle, automatic caretaking)</li>
<li>Struggle with doubt: "I've prayed every day for ten years. If the Unnamed God cared about my vows, why can I still channel His power?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>

<h3>Before Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have warning, cast <em>shield of faith</em> on your frontline fighter (+2 AC for 10 minutes)</li>
<li>Position yourself in the middle of the party—close enough to heal, far enough to avoid melee</li>
</ul>

<h3>First Round</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cast <em>spiritual weapon</em> (bonus action to summon, attacks as bonus action each round for 1 minute—excellent sustained damage)</li>
<li>Use action for <em>sacred flame</em> (2d8 radiant damage) or <em>sanctuary</em> on a vulnerable ally</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healing:</strong> Use <em>cure wounds</em> when allies drop below half HP. Remember Shepherd of Souls: healing spells also grant temp HP!</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> <em>Calm emotions</em> can end charm/fear effects or suppress hostility in humanoids</li>
<li><strong>Buff:</strong> <em>Beacon of hope</em> is incredible for tough fights (advantage on Wis saves, max healing, affects multiple allies)</li>
<li><strong>Dispel:</strong> Use <em>dispel magic</em> to counter magical traps, buffs on enemies, or ongoing effects</li>
<li><strong>Protection:</strong> <em>Sanctuary</em> on downed allies to stop enemies from finishing them off</li>
</ul>

<h3>Channel Divinity Use</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Heretics:</strong> Use against Yackle or other witch-type enemies to force them away from the party</li>
<li><strong>Convert the Masses:</strong> Shell probably won't use this unless desperate—it feels too much like her mauntery training</li>
</ul>

<h3>Against Yackle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Use Turn Heretics to force her back. Cast <em>spiritual weapon</em> and attack with it every round while healing allies. <em>Dispel magic</em> her buffs.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> When she merges with the house, focus on keeping the party alive. <em>Beacon of hope</em> for sustained healing and save advantages. Use <em>dispel magic</em> on her connection points.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Burn remaining spell slots on damage or healing as needed. If she uses her final curse, <em>lesser restoration</em> might help if it causes a condition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Character Development</h2>

<h3>If Shell Survives</h3>
<ul>
<li>She might finally accept that her divine power doesn't require institutional approval—her compassion is enough</li>
<li>She could use inheritance money to help other mauntery escapees start new lives</li>
<li>She might return to St. Prowd's—not as a penitent, but as a liberator, helping others escape</li>
<li>Or she might find a way to wield divine magic entirely separated from Unionism, proving faith and church are not the same</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Character Arc</h3>
<p>Shell begins the adventure still psychologically imprisoned by the mauntery—second-guessing herself, apologizing for existing, afraid of authority. By the end, she might reclaim her agency, realizing that compassion and divine power don't require submission to corrupt institutions. She could become Oona again, or choose to remain Sister Shell on her own terms. Either way, she'll decide for herself.</p>

<h2>GM Notes</h2>

<h3>Using Shell in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Party Healer:</strong> Shell is the primary support character. Make sure combat encounters threaten the party enough that her healing matters.</li>
<li><strong>Religious Expertise:</strong> Shell can recognize Unionist symbols, rituals, and theological references throughout the manor. Use this to feed her information.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Vulnerability:</strong> Yackle can manipulate Shell by exploiting her guilt, her indecision, or her fear of authority. This creates tension without requiring combat.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Mystery:</strong> The fact that Shell can still use Unionist divine magic despite abandoning the church is theologically significant. What does this mean about the Unnamed God? About the nature of divine power?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plot Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shell discovers a private chapel in the manor dedicated to a god she doesn't recognize—older than Unionism</li>
<li>Yackle reveals she donated money to St. Prowd's specifically to ensure Shell's indoctrination: "I've been watching you for years, dear."</li>
<li>One of the other heirs is a zealous Unionist who tries to convince Shell to return to the church</li>
<li>Shell must choose: use Convert the Masses to save the party (embracing her training) or refuse and find another way (rejecting her past)</li>
</ul>
