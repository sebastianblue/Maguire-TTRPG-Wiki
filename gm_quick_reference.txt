<h2>The Core Premise</h2>

<h2>Key NPCs</h2>

<h3>Mr. Trism (The Solicitor)</h3>

<li><strong>Secret:</strong> Dead. Killed by Yackle 3 days ago, reanimated as puppet</li>

</ul>

<h2>Critical Mechanics</h2>

<h3>Memory Extraction (Yackle's Bonus Action)</h3>
<p>Target one creature within 30 feet. Wisdom save DC 16 or Yackle learns one secret memory. If the memory is one of the Eight Inversions, she collects it for power.</p>
<p><strong>Immunity:</strong> Once a character has willingly revealed their secret to Yackle (roleplay, not extraction), they're immune to this ability.</p>

<h3>Lair Actions (Phase 2)</h3>
<p>On initiative count 20, Yackle uses one lair action. Cannot repeat the last one used.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grasping Walls:</strong> DC 15 Str save or restrained</li>
<li><strong>Shifting Corridors:</strong> Teleport one creature to random room</li>
<li><strong>Memory Flood:</strong> DC 15 Wis save or stunned (relive victim's memory)</li>
<li><strong>Summon Shade:</strong> Memory Shade (CR 3) appears</li>
<li><strong>Collapsing Floor:</strong> DC 15 Dex save or 3d6 damage, fall prone</li>
<li><strong>Extinguish:</strong> All magical light in one room snuffed</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Puzzle Box: I L O V E U</h3>
<p>Six-letter code hidden throughout the house. Letters found in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I</strong> — Portrait Gallery (carved in frame)</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> — Library (journal entry circled)</li>
<li><strong>O</strong> — Music Room (sheet music title first letters)</li>
<li><strong>V</strong> — Chapel (altar inscription)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> — Greenhouse (arrangement of dead flowers)</li>
<li><strong>U</strong> — Master Bedroom (circled in unfinished letter)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reward when solved:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Map to Heart Chamber</li>
<li>Lurline's Word scroll (4d10 radiant damage, no save, one use)</li>
<li>Flash of Genius ability (add Int mod to save/check, 3 uses)</li>

<h2>Possible Endings</h2>

<h3>1. Total Victory</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> All 7 seals complete, defeat Yackle, most players survive<br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> House becomes neutral safe haven. Players inherit estate and Yackle's knowledge. Bindings remain intact.</p>

<h3>2. Pyrrhic Victory</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Defeat Yackle but 4+ players dead, OR Yackle reaches Phase 4 but is stopped<br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> House collapses. Survivors escape barely. Estate destroyed but Oz is saved.</p>

<h3>3. Mercy</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Players convince Yackle to accept oblivion (DC 20 Persuasion/Insight check)<br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Yackle disperses peacefully. House fades. Players each receive a gift from her final act of sacrifice. Bittersweet.</p>

<h3>4. The Unmaking (BAD END)</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Yackle collects all 8 secrets and isn't stopped in Phase 4<br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> The Eight Bindings begin to fray. Reality around the estate becomes unstable. Yackle achieves oblivion but takes a piece of Oz with her. The Pertha Hills become a "blighted zone" where the rules of reality don't fully apply. Survivors flee, traumatized.</p>

<h3>5. Stalemate</h3>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> Players escape house before defeating Yackle, OR all players die<br>
<strong>Outcome:</strong> Yackle remains trapped. In another century, she'll call new heirs. The cycle continues.</p>

<h2>Common GM Pitfalls & Solutions</h2>

<h3>Pitfall: Players suspect Viridian too early</h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Have Yackle/Viridian share a "secret" that's emotionally true (her loneliness, her exhaustion) even if the backstory is false. Make her sympathetic. Red herring another player with suspicious behavior.</p>

<h3>Pitfall: Players refuse to share secrets</h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Yackle can use Memory Extraction (Wis save DC 16). Seals require vulnerability to complete. House horrors threaten them individually, forcing cooperation.</p>

<h3>Pitfall: Combat takes too long</h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Phase 2 is a chase, not full combat. Phase 3 starts with anchors pre-damaged if time is short. Skip Phase 2 entirely if running behind.</p>

<h3>Pitfall: Players get lost in 22 rooms</h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ghost child guides them. Seal locations glow faintly (Perception DC 12). Map handout shows rough layout.</p>

<h3>Pitfall: Too many secrets revealed early</h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Yackle must be present (within 30 feet) to collect. She'll engineer situations to be nearby when secrets might emerge.</p>

<h2>Pacing Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>If ahead of schedule:</strong> Add more atmospheric exploration, deeper NPC roleplay, extra house horror encounters</li>
<li><strong>If behind schedule:</strong> Skip Phase 2 chase, start Phase 3 with anchors damaged, reduce HP pools by 25%</li>
<li><strong>If party is struggling:</strong> Holly offers direct help, discovery abilities become easier to find, reduce DCs by 2</li>
<li><strong>If party is dominating:</strong> Yackle collects secrets faster, adds more lair actions, uses environment creatively</li>
</ul>
