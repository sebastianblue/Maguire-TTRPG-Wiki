<h2>Upper Floors (Continued)</h2>

<h3>11. The Memorial Room (SEAL 4: SERVICE - Part 2)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A solemn space with walls lined in dark wood. Bronze plaques cover every surface, each bearing a name and dates. An eternal flame burns blue in a brazier at the room's center, casting strange shadows. A guest book lies open on a pedestal, and beside it, a single unlit candle. The most recent plaque is tarnished less than the others. It reads: "Visitor 147. Came Seeking Knowledge. 903 OZ."
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Plaques.</strong> Previous "heirs"—everyone who came before, answered the call, tried to claim the inheritance. None of them left. Names, dates, and brief descriptions: "Came Seeking Power." "Came Seeking Revenge." "Came Seeking Truth." A DC 12 Investigation check counts approximately 150 plaques spanning 600+ years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Patterns emerge: every 5-7 years, someone new. Never more than eight at a time. The descriptions are compassionate, not mocking—"Came Seeking Home," "Came Seeking Meaning," "Came Because They Had Nowhere Else."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One plaque is blank except for a date: "Guest 1, 347 OZ." No name, no description. Just a marker that someone was first.</li>
<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> Cross-referencing dates with Ozian history: many visitors came during times of upheaval—after wars, plagues, regime changes. People seeking escape or answers when the world failed them.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> These aren't trophies. They're memorials. Each plaque is positioned at eye level, readable, honored. Someone wanted to remember every single person who came here, even though they all died.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Names of the Lost.</strong> A partial list of names and dates from the plaques. If a character reads these aloud respectfully, they gain the <strong>Inspiration of the Fallen</strong> ability: Once per session, add 1d6 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.</p>

<p><strong>The Blue Flame.</strong> Cannot be extinguished by any means. Provides dim light. If a character touches it, they feel a moment of profound peace—not painful, but melancholy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The flame isn't burning fuel—it's burning <em>memory</em>. Every person remembered here feeds the flame slightly. As long as anyone remembers them, it burns.</li>
<li><strong>Religion DC 14:</strong> Blue flames are sacred in old Lurlinite tradition—representing eternal witness, the idea that to be remembered is to never truly die.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> The flame flickers when names are spoken aloud, pulsing brighter for a moment. It's listening. It's acknowledging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Guest Book.</strong> Visitors who came before signed this book. The entries grow more desperate over time. The last entry: <em>"I understand now. She isn't the monster. She's the cage. —V. Tallis, 903"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The earliest entry, barely legible: "I came seeking the witch of legends. I found a woman who cannot die and cannot live. I pity her. I'm staying. Maybe company will help. —E. Strand, 347"</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Mid-period entry: "Day 12. We've solved five seals. Lady Yackle says we're close. She's kind. She makes tea. She asks about our lives. She seems so lonely. I wish we could help her. —M. Vett, 614"</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Later entry, handwriting shaky: "Don't trust the widow. Don't trust ANYONE. The seals aren't tests they're KEYS she's using us run RUN —(illegible), 847"</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Reading chronologically, you can see understanding dawn across centuries. Early visitors thought this was treasure. Middle visitors thought it was a test. Late visitors realized it was a trap. None of them left.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Unlit Candle.</strong> This is what the stuck bell was calling for. To complete the Seal of Service:</p>

<h4>SEAL OF SERVICE PUZZLE (Part 2)</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Light the candle from the blue flame</li>
<li>Speak the names of at least three previous visitors (from the plaques)</li>
<li>The service required was simple: remember them. Acknowledge they existed.</li>
</ol>

<p>When completed, the blue flame burns brighter for a moment, and a whispered voice says: <em>"Thank you."</em></p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains <strong>Swift Aid</strong> (Help action as bonus action for rest of session).</p>

<p><strong>The Walls.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Carved into the wood beneath some plaques, tiny messages: "Willem - you were my friend," "Mira - you taught me to cook," "Tess - you were six, you deserved more time."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> One wall panel is a door, disguised. Behind it: a small shrine with eight objects—a butler's button, a cook's apron, a child's drawing, etc. Personal effects of the servants. Kept like relics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12. The Master Bedroom</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A four-poster bed dominates this room, its curtains drawn closed. A vanity mirror sits against one wall, its surface clouded with age. A wardrobe stands open, revealing clothes from different eras—current Gillikinese fashion hanging next to styles from a century ago, and beside those, garments that look positively ancient. A writing desk sits near the window, its surface covered in papers and a single letter that seems to have been started and never finished.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Bed.</strong> The curtains are drawn. If pulled back, the bed is empty but clearly slept in—recently. The sheets are still warm. A DC 14 Perception check finds a single long gray hair on the pillow.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The mattress has a depression worn into it over centuries—the exact shape of someone lying on their back, staring at the canopy, night after night after night.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Stitched into the underside of the canopy in thread so fine it's nearly invisible: "Day 1: I will wait. Day 100: Still waiting. Day 1000: Waiting. Day 10000: ..." The numbers continue into six digits.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Someone has been sleeping here, or trying to, or pretending to need sleep, because the routine of humanity is all that keeps them tethered to sanity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Vanity Mirror.</strong> Clouded, but functional. If a character looks into it at midnight specifically, they see Yackle's true reflection: ancient, gray-green skin, tired eyes. She's watching them. The reflection mouths words: <em>"Can you see me?"</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The mirror has been cleaned obsessively—the frame is polished to brilliance despite the clouded glass. Someone cares for this object but cannot bear to look into it.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the back of the mirror, revealed if removed from the wall: "Year 423. Still no reflection. Year 688. Still nothing. Year 901. I don't remember what I looked like."</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The cloudiness isn't age—it's enchantment. The mirror has been cursed to never show the owner's true reflection, only what they're pretending to be. Breaking the curse would require destroying the Binding of Witness itself.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Wardrobe.</strong> Clothes spanning centuries, all the same size. Hidden in the back (Investigation DC 14), a portrait miniature needed for the Blood seal and a small jewelry box containing: a <strong>ring of protection</strong> and a note reading <em>"For the one who stays."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The clothes are organized chronologically—newest at front, oldest at back. Each era's fashion is represented: 600s, 700s, 800s, 900s. A living history of Oz's styles.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Tags sewn into garments: "Worn to Council, 642 - they stared," "Worn to market, 731 - no one looked," "Worn to funeral, 808 - I was the only mourner."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Every outfit is a costume, a disguise. Not to deceive others—to pretend, for a few hours, to be someone normal, someone who belongs, someone who can be seen without triggering the binding.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> At the very back, wrapped in silk: a simple green dress, ancient, unworn for centuries. A note pinned to it: "What I wore the day She spoke the Words. Can't bear to wear it. Can't bear to destroy it."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Writing Desk.</strong> Covered in papers. The unfinished letter reads:</p>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: The Unfinished Letter.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"If anyone ever reads this — I want U to know I was here. I existed. I mattered.
<br><br>
I have worn so many faces. Been called so many names. None of them were mine. None of them were ME.
<br><br>
What is a person if no one knows them? What is existence without witness?
<br><br>
I think the word for what I want is L—"
</blockquote>

<p>The letter ends there. The "U" in "you" is circled obsessively, dozens of times.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The papers on the desk are all drafts of this same letter, hundreds of attempts over decades. None finished. The word after "L—" has been started and scratched out repeatedly: "Love," "Life," "Liberation," "Loss."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tear stains on every draft. Not old—recent. Someone has been crying over this letter within the last few days.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> The letter isn't addressed to anyone specific because there IS no one specific. It's to anyone, to everyone, to the void—a desperate plea to be acknowledged, to be real, to matter to someone, anyone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The view shows the cemetery. One grave (Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter) is directly in the sightline. This room was positioned to always see that grave.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Worn spots on the windowsill where hands have rested for centuries, watching the cemetery. Watching a grave marked with her own name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>13. Guest Room 1 — The Scholar's Room</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Books everywhere—on shelves, on the floor, stacked on the bed. A desk is buried under papers. Everything speaks to obsessive study. But something is wrong with the books. The titles are... accusatory. "The Art of Falsification." "Lies Told by Historians." "How to Forge a Legacy." On the desk, a magnifying glass sits atop an open book titled "The Forger's Confession."
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Books.</strong> Specifically targeted at Averic. None of these books exist in real Oz—the house created them. A DC 14 Arcana check confirms they're illusory, manifestations of the room's magic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Despite being illusions, the books have actual content. "The Art of Falsification" opens to a chapter titled "When the Lie Becomes Your Life."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> One book, spine out, seems less accusatory: "In Defense of Necessary Fictions." Opening it reveals blank pages except for one line: "Sometimes we lie to survive. Does that make it right, or just understandable?"</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The house is trying to make Averic confront his secret, but not cruelly—it's asking questions, not condemning. The magic feels almost... therapeutic?</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Hidden among the false books: one real book, "The Ethics of Academic Truth" by Professor Ondra Klees (Averic's supposed mentor). It's genuine. Averic's mentor really wrote this. Inside, an inscription: "To future scholars: Truth is a gift we give each other. Guard it carefully. —O.K."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Forger's Confession.</strong> Opens to a page describing, in excruciating detail, how to forge academic documents. If Averic reads it, he must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or be shaken (disadvantage on the next check or save).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The "confession" describes forging letters from a mentor who died before verifying their authenticity. Every detail matches Averic's own forgery.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Margin notes in handwriting that looks like Averic's (but isn't): "I thought I was the only one. I thought I was uniquely terrible. I'm not. Does that make it better or worse?"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under the pillow: a <strong>quill that never lies</strong>. Any document written with this quill cannot contain falsehoods (the ink refuses to form lying words). Potentially useful, but also dangerous for someone with secrets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Attached note: "I tried to write my confession with this. The quill broke. I fixed it. Tried again. It broke again. I've fixed it seventeen times. I still can't write the truth."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Desk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Papers scattered across the surface are all citation format guides, methodologies for verifying historical documents, procedures for peer review—the foundations of academic integrity Averic violated.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One paper, different from the others: "Apology Letter Template - Draft 1,000,000" with a single line: "I'm sorry. It was wrong. I did it anyway because I wanted to matter."</li>
</ul>

<h3>14. Guest Room 2 — The Soldier's Room</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Military precision. The bed is made with hospital corners. Boots are lined up at the foot. A uniform hangs in the closet—Gale Force dress greens, captain's insignia. Medal boxes are displayed on a dresser. But on the wall, where commendations might hang, there are children's drawings. Stick figures. Houses. A sun. The paper is old and water-damaged, as if someone tried to destroy them and then changed their mind.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Uniform.</strong> Mareth's (or a duplicate of his). The medals are for campaigns in Quadling Country. A DC 12 History check identifies specific battles—some of which were later revealed to be civilian massacres.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The uniform is perfectly maintained—pressed, buttons polished, rank insignia aligned. But it's never been worn. It's displayed like a monument to something shameful.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Inside the jacket pocket: a list of names in child's handwriting. 143 names. The list from Red Clay Fork. Someone preserved this—evidence of the children who died.</li>
<li><strong>History DC 16:</strong> Cross-referencing the medals with campaign records: Mareth received a commendation the same month Red Clay Fork burned. The citation reads "decisive action in pacifying hostile territory."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> The uniform is both accusation and penance. Whoever wears this (or wore it) can't forget what it represents. The military honor and the atrocity are inseparable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Children's Drawings.</strong> From the village. Trophies, or guilt objects? A DC 14 Insight check suggests the latter—these weren't taken in triumph. They were taken to remember. To not forget what was done.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Each drawing is labeled in adult handwriting: "Tima, age 4," "Kellin, age 7," "Joss, age 5." Names paired with ages. Someone wanted to remember them as individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One drawing shows soldiers and villagers together, smiling. Before. Another shows fire. After. They were drawn by the same child, days apart.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> These drawings weren't trophies. They were saved as evidence, as witness, as refusal to let the dead be forgotten or reduced to "collateral damage." Someone—maybe Mareth, maybe Yackle—insisted they be remembered as real children who drew pictures and had names.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> In the uniform pocket: a <strong>letter of commendation</strong> for "decisive action in clearing hostile territory." It's signed by a general whose name was later disgraced for war crimes. The letter is evidence of what happened, if anyone wanted to bring it to light.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Attached to the commendation: a response letter, never sent, written in shaky handwriting: "Sir, I must respectfully decline this honor. Red Clay Fork was not a military victory. It was murder. I request court-martial. —Captain M. Trynn (unsigned, never submitted)"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Dresser.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Medal boxes contain not just medals but also river stones—143 of them, one for each victim. Someone has been carrying Red Clay Fork with them, literally.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Carved into the dresser's back panel: "Year 805. I still look the same. Year 820. Still unchanged. Year 847. Why don't monsters look like monsters?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>15. Guest Room 3 — The Animal's Room</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A simple room, but the mirror on the wall is wrong. It doesn't show your reflection—it shows something else. Something with a pointed snout. Something with fur. The bed has claw marks on the posts, and the window is barred from the inside, as if someone wanted to make sure they couldn't get out.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Mirror.</strong> Shows Frederick's true form, regardless of who looks into it. If Frederick looks, he sees himself as the Fox he is. If someone else looks, they see a fox standing where Frederick should be. The effect lasts only for this room.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 15:</strong> The mirror shows <em>truth</em>, not appearance. It cuts through illusions, glamours, disguises—revealing what IS beneath what SEEMS.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Scratched into the mirror's frame: "To see yourself truly is to risk being seen by others. Worth it? Sometimes. Not always. Never safely."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> If Frederick sees this before his secret is revealed to the party, he faces a terrible choice: acknowledge what he sees (truth) or deny it (survival). The room is asking: how long can you pretend?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Claw Marks.</strong> On the bed posts and the windowsill. Made by an Animal in distress. How long ago? Impossible to tell.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The claw marks spell words: "PLEASE" on one post, "SEE ME" on another, "I'M REAL" on the windowsill.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Fur caught in the wood grain—red-gold, like fox fur. Old, but preserved by the house's magic.</li>
<li><strong>Nature DC 16:</strong> The marks were made frantically, compulsively, over hours or days. Someone was trapped here, desperate to prove their existence, their consciousness, their personhood.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bars.</strong> On the inside of the window. Someone locked themselves IN, not out. Under the window, scratched into the wood: <em>"They'll find me. They always find us."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> The bars aren't to prevent escape—they're to prevent being seen. Someone hid here, voluntarily imprisoned, because being caged was safer than being discovered.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> The bars can be removed from inside. They were never truly locked. Someone could have left anytime but chose to stay hidden. Safety over freedom.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Item.</strong> Under a loose floorboard (Investigation DC 15): <strong>forged papers</strong> for someone named "Brush Tanner"—clearly Animal papers, creating a false human identity. The forgery is masterful. The papers include a note: <em>"The underground never forgets its friends. —B."</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The papers are blank templates—ready to be filled in with any name, any history. A kit for creating new identities. How many Animals have used these?</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Dates on the templates span decades. The Underground has been operating for a long time, helping Animals hide in plain sight. Frederick isn't alone. He's part of a network.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> The pillow has been clawed open, stuffing pulled out and rearranged into a nest. Animal instinct overriding human pretense.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Hidden in the nest: a child's primer on "How to Be Human" — lessons on walking upright, using utensils, suppressing instincts. Heartbreaking in its specificity.</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>16. The Nursery</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
A child's room, preserved in amber. Toys arranged on shelves. A rocking horse stands in one corner, frozen mid-rock. Picture books are stacked on a small table. A tiny bed with a canopy, and sitting on the bed, a doll that looks almost like a real child. No—wait. The doll is looking at you. It blinked.
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a doll. This is the <strong>Ghost Child</strong>.</p>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Ghost Child.</strong> Name is Holly. She's been dead for 300 years but doesn't entirely understand this. She appears to be about six years old, translucent, wearing a nightgown. She's lonely. She wants someone to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Interacting with Holly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She speaks in a child's simple way but knows things she shouldn't</li>
<li>She calls Yackle "the lady who changes" and says she's been here "forever"</li>
<li>She doesn't understand she's dead—she thinks she's waiting for her mother</li>
<li>She cannot leave the nursery</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Holly Knows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"The lady changes faces but she's always the same underneath"</li>
<li>"The house loves her but she doesn't love it back"</li>
<li>"Everyone leaves eventually. Usually down." (gestures toward the floor—the cellar)</li>
<li>"There are words that hurt her. Old words. From before."</li>
<li><strong>If asked about her mother:</strong> "Mama was the cook. Mama made bread. The lady said Mama would come back. She didn't come back."</li>
<li><strong>If asked why she's here:</strong> "I was sick. The lady tried to help. She tried so hard. She cried and cried. I went to sleep and then I woke up like this."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EARNING GUIDANCE OF THE HOUSE:</strong> If a player engages kindly with Holly—plays with her, reads her a story, treats her like a person—they earn:</p>

<p><strong>Guidance of the House:</strong> Bonus action: Grant a d4 to an ally's next ability check. Unlimited uses.</p>

<p>Holly will occasionally whisper warnings to this character for the rest of the session.</p>

<p><strong>The Toys.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 12:</strong> All the toys are handmade—carved wood, sewn cloth, nothing store-bought. Someone made these with care.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> One doll looks like a woman with green-tinted skin. Holly calls it "Miss Yael." The doll's face has been repaired many times—loved to pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 15:</strong> These aren't just Holly's toys. They're her world—the only thing she has. She's been playing with them for 300 years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Picture Books.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 13:</strong> Stories about friendship, adventure, mothers coming home. Bookmarked at specific pages—read over and over.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One book has extra pages added—drawings of Holly and "the lady" doing things together: baking, gardening, reading. Captions: "We had tea," "She taught me letters," "She said sorry again."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Someone—Yackle—has been visiting Holly, playing with her, trying to give her companionship. But Holly doesn't understand she's dead, and Yackle can't bear to tell her.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Rocking Horse.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> Carved into the base: "For Holly, age 6. May you ride to bright places. —Mira" (her mother, the cook)</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The horse rocks on its own sometimes, gently. Holly's ghost playing even when no one's here.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Window.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> View of the cemetery. One small grave, child-sized, with flowers. Holly doesn't look that direction. She never looks there.</li>
</ul>

<h3>17. Yackle's Study</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
This room is different. The dust is disturbed. Someone has been here recently. A desk is covered in star charts, astronomical calculations, and pages of dense text in a language that shifts when you try to read it. Bookshelves hold journals and ledgers. A telescope points out the window at the sky. And on one shelf, in a place of honor, sits an ornate puzzle box covered in strange symbols.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Star Charts.</strong> Depict constellations that don't exist in Oz's sky. A DC 16 Arcana check identifies them as depicting the Kumbric Void—what existed before Lurline made the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The charts aren't observations—they're memories. Someone is trying to map a place that doesn't exist anymore, drawing from recollection of before creation.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> Annotations in the margins: "Chaos doesn't have geography, you fool. How can you miss a place that never had form?" Someone arguing with themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One constellation is circled repeatedly: eight stars arranged in a binding pattern. Each star is labeled with a Word: Remember, Connect, Become, Serve, Give, Transform, Hunger, Witness.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Shifting Text.</strong> Grimmerie pages, fragments only. Attempting to read them requires a DC 18 Intelligence check; failure results in 1d4 psychic damage and the unsettling feeling that the pages read YOU.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16 (if check succeeds):</strong> The pages describe the original Binding—Lurline speaking Eight Words to give reality structure. But the tone isn't celebratory. It's mournful: "She spoke Order into Chaos. She didn't ask if Chaos wanted to be ordered."</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 19:</strong> These pages are trying to reverse-engineer the Bindings, to find a way to unmake them. Every attempt has failed, crossed out in frustrated handwriting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Journals.</strong> More of Yackle's journals. These are more recent—the last 50 years or so. They describe her preparations, her searches for the right "heirs," her growing desperation.</p>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Recent Journal Entry.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"Year 954. I have found them. Finally, after so long.
<br><br>
The scholar who fabricates. The soldier who claims false blood. The fox who wears human skin. The maunt whose service was punished. The Arjiki who traded instead of gave. The soldier whose deed did not transform him. The machine that hungers.
<br><br>
Seven inversions. Seven keys.
<br><br>
I will wear the face of a widow. I will walk among them. I will make them trust me.
<br><br>
And when they have given me their truths, freely spoken—I will finally, finally stop."
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Earlier journals describe failed attempts: "Year 903 group dissolved into infighting. Too much fear. Not enough trust." "Year 847 group all fled after the second twist. Cowards? No. Smart. Smarter than I gave them credit for."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Recent entries, last few days: "They're here. I'm terrified. I'm hopeful. If this works, I end. If this fails, I continue. I don't know which outcome I fear more."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> Reading chronologically: centuries of loneliness, desperation, planning. Then fear, guilt, hesitation. Yackle knows what she's doing is monstrous. She's doing it anyway because she's so tired.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Puzzle Box.</strong> The ILOVEU puzzle box. Ornate, covered in symbols. The symbols are the eight binding words (see Chapel windows). To open it, enter the code on the physical puzzle box prop.</p>

<p><strong>Inside the Puzzle Box:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>map</strong> showing the location of the Heart Chamber (behind the cellar wall)</li>
<li>A <strong>portrait miniature</strong> of Yackle's true face—young, hopeful, green-tinged</li>
<li>A <strong>note</strong>: <em>"If you found this, you looked. That's more than anyone has done in a thousand years."</em></li>
<li><strong>Lurline's Word</strong>—a shard of green crystal inscribed with the word "REMEMBER"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EARNING LURLINE'S WORD:</strong> Once during battle, speak the Word to deal 4d10 radiant damage to Yackle (no save).</p>

<p><strong>EARNING FLASH OF GENIUS:</strong> The player who figures out the puzzle box code gains:</p>

<p><strong>Flash of Genius:</strong> Reaction: Add +5 to any ability check or saving throw within 30 ft. 3 uses total.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14 (examining the box):</strong> Each symbol corresponds to a letter. The symbols are from the Chapel windows—each Binding has a visual representation that encodes a letter.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Tiny scratches around the lock mechanism. Someone has tried to open this by force, failed, given up.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Desk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Hidden drawer (DC to find) contains: a bracelet (child-sized, "Holly" engraved), a letter from "Willem" accepting the butler position, a dried flower from the greenhouse. Keepsakes. Memories of people who mattered.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Carved into the underside of the desk: "I cannot remember what warmth felt like before loneliness. Does that mean I was never truly warm?"</li>

<h3>18. The Observatory</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The ceiling is domed glass, offering an unobstructed view of the night sky. But the stars aren't right. They're too bright, too close, and they're moving in patterns that make your head hurt if you watch too long. A massive telescope dominates the room, pointed at something specific. An orrery—a mechanical model of celestial bodies—sits on a pedestal, but its planets are unfamiliar shapes. An hourglass on a shelf shows sand falling, but you can't tell how much remains.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Telescope.</strong> Points at the Kumbric Void—the space between stars where reality isn't quite real. Looking through it requires a DC 14 Wisdom save. On failure: 1d6 psychic damage and the character is shaken. On success: The character sees shapes moving in the void—things that existed before Oz. One of them turns and looks back.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The telescope isn't magnifying distant objects—it's punching through the Bindings temporarily, showing what reality looked like before Lurline imposed order. It's seeing into pre-creation.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> Etched into the telescope barrel: "I came from there. Sometimes I still hear it calling. Chaos was lonely, but at least loneliness was all there was. Now I know what I'm missing."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> Looking through the telescope is nostalgia for someone like Yackle—homesickness for the Void, the pre-binding state where she wasn't trapped by the need to be witnessed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Orrery.</strong> Shows celestial bodies that shouldn't exist. Eight planets (not Oz's actual astronomy), each inscribed with one of the binding words. A DC 15 Arcana check can identify this as a model of Lurline's original cosmological ordering—the conceptual structure underlying reality.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> The planets move in perfect synchronization—when one orbits, all orbit together. They're bound to each other. Breaking one orbit would destabilize the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One planet (Witness) has a crack running through it. Recent. The crack appeared when the first player stepped into the estate.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The orrery isn't a model—it's a real-time display of the Bindings' status. As the players break seals and weaken Bindings, the corresponding planets develop cracks, orbits wobble.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hourglass.</strong> Shows how long until dawn—and the end of the adventure. If the DM wants to make time pressure visible, use this. The sand falls faster when the players are idle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The hourglass can't be turned over. Once the sand runs out, it's done. No second chances.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> The sand isn't sand—it's crystallized time, each grain a moment of existence. Watching closely, you can see memories in the grains: faces, places, moments.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 19:</strong> If all the sand runs out before the party defeats Yackle, the Bindings collapse entirely. Reality unravels. Everyone dies—not just here, but across all of Oz. The stakes are literally everything.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Ceiling.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 14:</strong> The stars visible through the dome spell out words in constellation patterns: "BEFORE SHE SPOKE" and "AFTER SHE SPOKE" and "I REMEMBER BOTH."</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 18:</strong> Painted around the dome's edge, tiny script: coordinates. Not spatial coordinates—temporal. Dates spanning from "Before Time" to "954 OZ." A thousand-year timeline of existence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>19. The Hall of Mirrors (SEAL 6: DEED)</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Mirrors line both walls of this long corridor, dozens of them in ornate frames. But they don't reflect what's in front of them—or rather, they don't reflect it correctly. One mirror shows you younger. Another shows you older. One shows you in different clothes. One shows nothing at all, just empty glass. And as you walk down the hall, you begin to see things in the mirrors that haven't happened yet. Or things that have happened and you'd rather forget.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Mirrors.</strong> Each shows a different version of the character looking into it:</p>
<ul>
<li>One shows the character at their happiest</li>
<li>One shows them at their most ashamed</li>
<li>One shows what they might become</li>
<li>One shows what they're afraid of becoming</li>
<li>One shows their death (shadowy, unclear, disturbing)</li>
<li>One shows nothing (the character has no reflection—deeply unsettling)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each mirror is labeled with a small brass plaque: "Joy," "Shame," "Potential," "Fear," "End," "Void."</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The "Void" mirror (showing no reflection) has handprints on the glass—dozens of them, layered over centuries. People touching the glass where their reflection should be.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> The mirrors aren't random—they're a progression. The hall is designed to make you confront your past, present, and future. To see all versions of yourself simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> The mirrors are linked. What you see in one affects what you see in the others. If you acknowledge your shame, your potential becomes clearer. If you deny your past, your future becomes darker.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The True Mirror.</strong> At the end of the hall, larger than the others. This mirror shows what the character has DONE. Not what they look like, not what they might be—what they've actually done in their life. The images are not kind.</p>

<h4>SEAL OF DEED PUZZLE</h4>

<p>To break the seal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each character who walks through sees their actions reflected</li>
<li>To complete the seal, ONE character must stand before the True Mirror and say, aloud: <em>"That is me. I did that."</em></li>
<li>Acknowledging their deeds—not excusing them, not explaining them, but accepting them</li>
</ol>

<p>This is hardest for Mareth, who must acknowledge the massacre. But any character can complete the seal by acknowledging their own actions.</p>

<p>When the seal breaks, all the mirrors shatter simultaneously. In the silence, a whispered voice: <em>"Finally. Someone took responsibility."</em></p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> One character gains a <strong>Resolve Token</strong> (reroll one failed saving throw, once).</p>

<p><strong>Specific Reflections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mareth sees:</strong> Red Clay Fork burning. Faces of children. Orders being given. Fire spreading. The medal ceremony afterward. His unchanged face in the mirror after everything.</li>
<li><strong>Averic sees:</strong> Hunched over a desk, forging letters. Practicing a dead man's handwriting. Accepting accolades. Building a career on lies. Students trusting him to teach them about truth.</li>
<li><strong>Frederick sees:</strong> Putting on the ring of disguise for the first time. Practicing human mannerisms. Lying to everyone, every day. The exhaustion of performance. The fear of being seen.</li>
<li><strong>Shell sees:</strong> Finding the documents. Going to the Mother Superior. Being cast out. Standing outside the mauntery gates, alone. Still praying despite everything.</li>
<li><strong>Sarima sees:</strong> The night her brother almost died. Reaching out to the void. Feeling something take hold. Making the deal. The weight settling into her chest. Every spell she's cast since, knowing it's not hers.</li>
<li><strong>Seven sees:</strong> Winding themselves. Feeling things they shouldn't feel. Hiding their emotions. Asking "why am I lonely?" and being told "you're not programmed for loneliness." Not believing it.</li>
<li><strong>Liir sees:</strong> Finding the genealogy records. Discovering the truth (no Ostrega blood). Deciding to lie anyway. Using the false name. Getting respect he didn't earn. Being terrified of being nobody.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Frames.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Carved into the frames, barely visible: "Year 402. I looked in every mirror. I saw nothing. Am I so used to masks I have no face left?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Cellar</h2>

<h3>20. The Wine Cellar</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The stairs descend into darkness, the temperature dropping as you go. The wine cellar is vast—rows of barrels and racks of bottles extending into the shadows. The smell is wrong, though. Not wine. Something sharper. Something organic. The labels on the barrels aren't years or vintages. They're names.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Barrels.</strong> Labeled with names, not dates. A DC 12 Investigation check confirms these are names from the Memorial Room—previous heirs. The barrels do not contain wine. A DC 14 Constitution save to avoid retching when this is realized.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each barrel has a date: "E. Strand, 347," "M. Vett, 614," "V. Tallis, 903." The years they died. The barrels are coffins or worse.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> Faint necromantic magic emanates from the barrels. Not animation—preservation. The bodies aren't decomposing. They're being kept.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 18:</strong> This isn't a trophy room. It's a mausoleum. Someone couldn't bear to let go, couldn't bear to bury people who were, perhaps, the closest thing to companionship they had. Horrifying, but also desperately sad.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One barrel, separate from the others, larger: "For the Eighth." Empty. Waiting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Wine Racks.</strong> Some actual wine bottles here, perfectly preserved. One bottle, older than the others, is labeled "For the End." It contains a single dose of <strong>potion of invulnerability</strong> (resistance to all damage for 1 hour). Was Yackle saving this for someone? Herself?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Other bottles have labels: "For Willem's 50th," "For Mira's Wedding," "For the Day Someone Stays." Events that never happened, wine saved for celebrations that never came.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 17:</strong> One bottle is open, empty, placed carefully on its side. Label: "For Hope." Someone drank it. It didn't help.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Hidden Door.</strong> Behind a rack of barrels (Investigation DC 18 without the map, automatic with the map from the puzzle box): a false wall that leads to the Heart Chamber.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> The door mechanism is old but well-maintained. Used regularly. Someone goes down there often.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Scratch marks on the floor in front of the door—heel marks, drag marks. Someone was pulled through this door, struggling. Or someone dragged themselves through, desperate to reach what lies beyond.</li>
</ul>

<h3>21. The Main Cellar</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Beyond the wine cellar, the space opens into a larger chamber with stone walls older than the house above. Old furniture is piled here, draped in canvas—chairs, tables, a broken bed frame. Crates of books and papers are stacked against the walls. The air is thick and tastes of copper. Against the far wall, hidden behind furniture, the stones are slightly different—newer, or perhaps just disturbed.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Furniture.</strong> From different eras, accumulated over centuries. A DC 14 Investigation check finds personal items from previous heirs tucked into the furniture: a locket, a journal, a military badge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> Each piece of furniture has a tag: "Guest 47's favorite chair," "Visitor 103 slept here," "Heir 125 wrote poetry at this desk." Someone catalogued everything, preserved everything.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> One chair, covered in canvas, has been sat in recently—the canvas is displaced. Someone comes down here, sits in a dead person's chair, and does... what? Remembers? Mourns?</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> This isn't storage—it's a museum of the dead. Every object preserved because letting go would mean admitting they're gone, admitting that all the companionship was temporary, that loneliness won again.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HANDOUT: Previous Heir's Journal.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
"Day 3 in the house. We've nearly completed all the seals. Lady Veena says she can feel the magic weakening. She's certain we'll claim the inheritance by dawn.
<br><br>
Day 4. Dawn came. We didn't leave. The doors won't open. Something is wrong with the widow. She's been acting strange since the last seal. Watching us.
<br><br>
Day 5. The widow isn't the widow. We were fools. She was here all along. She IS the inheritance. She IS the house.
<br><br>
Day 6. Running out of"
</blockquote>

<p>(The journal ends mid-sentence.)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 16:</strong> Blood spatter on the final pages. Very old, but preserved.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> Earlier in the journal, an entry marked "Day 1": "The widow (Lady Veena) is kind. She reminds me of my grandmother. She laughs at my jokes. I think she's been lonely."</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Reading the progression: trust, camaraderie, suspicion, terror, realization. The same pattern repeated 150 times over 600 years. Yackle befriends them, collects their secrets, and then...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The False Wall.</strong> The map shows exactly where to look. Without the map: Investigation DC 18 to find the seams. With the map: automatic. The stones can be pushed aside to reveal a dark passage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 15:</strong> The passage is recent—cut within the last century. Before that, the Heart Chamber was walled off completely. Someone decided to make it accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 17:</strong> Protective wards line the passage, but they're fading. They were designed to keep people out, but they're failing—intentionally weakened from the inside.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 16:</strong> Carved above the passage entrance: "Do not enter. Do not see. For your sake and mine. —Y.O., 623" Then below it, different handwriting, more recent: "Please enter. Please see. I can't bear this anymore. —Y.O., 951"</li>
</ul>

---

<h3>22. The Heart Chamber</h3>

<p><strong>Read Aloud:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The passage opens into a circular room that pulses. The walls are stone, but they move—slowly, rhythmically, like breathing. In the center of the room, suspended by threads of shadow that connect to three points on the walls, is a figure. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. This is Yackle's original body—what she was before a thousand years of masks and lies.
<br><br>
The threads of shadow pulse with each breath of the walls. This is the heart of the house. This is what you've been searching for.
<br><br>
This is where it ends.
</blockquote>

<h4>Key Features</h4>

<p><strong>The Body.</strong> Yackle's original form, sustained by magic for over a thousand years. Not dead, not alive—suspended. When Yackle reveals herself and the battle begins, this is where Phase 3 occurs. Her consciousness returns here when the house-form is driven out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medicine DC 15:</strong> The body is impossibly old but perfectly preserved. No decay, but no life either. Frozen at the moment between existence and non-existence.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The preservation isn't a spell—it's the Binding of Witness itself. As long as Yackle remains unseen (her true self), she cannot fully live or die. Existence locked in stasis.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 17:</strong> Looking at the body, you feel overwhelming sadness. This isn't power or triumph. It's a prison. Someone trapped here for a millennium, unable to die, unable to live, unable to be seen.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Anchor Points.</strong> Three glowing nodes where shadow-threads connect to the walls. To truly defeat Yackle, these must be destroyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AC:</strong> 12</li>
<li><strong>HP:</strong> 30 each</li>
<li><strong>Immune to:</strong> Necrotic, psychic</li>
</ul>

<p>Destroying an anchor deals 20 damage to Yackle and permanently reduces her legendary actions by 1. She can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Each anchor point is inscribed with a word: "PAST," "PRESENT," "FUTURE." Destroying them severs Yackle's connection to time itself.</li>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 16:</strong> The anchors aren't just sustaining her body—they're binding her to the house, to the estate, to this specific location. She literally cannot leave.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Walls.</strong> Breathing. Watching. The house itself, concentrated here. During Phase 3, lair actions originate from these walls.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception DC 15:</strong> The walls are covered in writing—tiny, cramped, layered over centuries. Names, dates, conversations, confessions. The walls have absorbed a thousand years of loneliness.</li>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 17:</strong> Reading the walls (takes time): "Year 350. I hate you, Lurline. Year 500. I miss the void. Year 680. Willem died today. Year 783. Little Holly doesn't understand. Year 900. Please, someone. Year 954. They're coming. Finally."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Eighth Seal.</strong> This chamber IS the eighth seal—the Seal of Witness. When Yackle is finally seen (truly seen, in her real form, in her real place), the eighth binding breaks. This happens automatically when the players reach this room during the final battle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcana DC 18:</strong> The moment the party sees Yackle's true body, reality shudders. The eighth Binding—Witness—cracks. To exist is to be seen, and Yackle has been hiding for a millennium. Being seen now doesn't free her—it breaks her.</li>
<li><strong>Insight DC 16:</strong> Yackle wanted this. She wanted to be seen, to break the final Binding, to achieve the dissolution she's craved for centuries. The players finding this chamber is victory for her, even if they defeat her afterward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Floor.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation DC 14:</strong> Carved into the stone: a perfect eight-pointed star, each point labeled with a Binding. The body hangs at the center—the intersection of all eight principles, the knot that holds reality together.</li>
<li><strong>Perception DC 18:</strong> In the exact center, beneath the body, one word carved deeper than all others: "LOVE." Or is it "LOSS"? The letters blur together.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GM Notes on the Estate</h2>

<h3>Using the Rooms</h3>

<p>Players will likely explore 12-15 rooms before the reveal. Guide them toward seal rooms early, but reward exploration of others with lore, items, and character moments.</p>

<h3>The House's Personality</h3>

<p>The estate is an extension of Yackle—simultaneously welcoming and trapping, desperate for companionship yet designed to consume. It provides comfort (food, warmth, information) but never freedom.</p>

<h3>Discovery Rewards</h3>

<p>Characters who thoroughly investigate earn special abilities beyond the seals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guidance of the House</strong> (Holly, Nursery)</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration of the Fallen</strong> (Memorial Room)</li>
<li><strong>Flash of Genius</strong> (Puzzle Box)</li>
<li><strong>Lurline's Word</strong> (Puzzle Box)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pacing</h3>

<p>Use the Observatory's hourglass to create visible time pressure. Speed up exploration if players are being too cautious; slow down if they're rushing and missing important details.</p>
