# The Witch's Wake — Complete Reference Document (Revised)
## A 4-Hour D&D 5e One-Shot in Gregory Maguire's Oz

---

# PART ONE: OVERVIEW

## Basic Information
- **Title:** The Witch's Wake
- **System:** D&D 5e
- **Duration:** 4 hours
- **Players:** 8
- **Level:** 5
- **Setting:** Gregory Maguire's Oz (Wicked series)
- **Location:** Yackle's Estate, Pertha Hills, Gillikin
- **Tone:** Gothic mystery, intrigue, wonder, horror (Haunting of Hill House energy)

## The Core Twist
One player is secretly Yackle, an ancient witch, disguised as "Madame Viridian." She has lured these seven specific people to her estate because each embodies the corruption of one of Lurline's Eight Bindings. By collecting their freely-given secrets, she can break the bindings that have trapped her for a millennium.

## The Premise

### What the Players Are Told
Eight strangers receive letters claiming they are named in the will of Yackle Ostreaga, a legendary witch thought long dead. They arrive at her remote estate in the Pertha Hills. A solicitor named Mr. Trism reads the will, which states that the heirs must unlock seven seals before dawn to prove their worthiness. The one who proves most worthy shall claim the greatest share of the inheritance.

### The First Twist (End of Hour 1)
The inheritance isn't for one person — it's for all survivors. And the amount each receives *increases* with more survivors. The house will now try to kill them. They must work together.

### The Second Twist (End of Hour 3)
One of them IS Yackle. She's been among them the whole time, collecting their secrets, preparing for the Unmaking. The final battle begins.

# PART TWO: THE COSMOLOGY

## The Eight Bindings of Lurline

Before Lurline came to Oz, there was the **Kumbric Void** — undifferentiated potential, chaos, a place where nothing was fixed. To make Oz habitable, Lurline imposed the Eight Bindings — principles that gave reality its shape.

| # | Binding | Principle | What It Prevents |
|---|---------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | **Memory** | The past is real and shapes the present | Time cannot be unwritten |
| 2 | **Blood** | Lineage connects beings across time | Ancestry is fixed |
| 3 | **Nature** | All beings are their kind | Nothing can be other than what it is |
| 4 | **Service** | Duty creates meaning through bonds | Power without obligation is chaos |
| 5 | **Sacrifice** | Giving freely creates value | You cannot gain without loss |
| 6 | **Deed** | Actions shape the actor | What you do becomes what you are |
| 7 | **Hunger** | Desire drives becoming, not consumption | Want must create, not devour |
| 8 | **Witness** | To exist is to be truly seen | You cannot be real while remaining unknown |

## Yackle's Nature

Yackle is a **shard of the Kumbric Witch** — the primordial being Lurline shattered to create Oz. She's been trapped in this house since the binding, unable to leave, unable to truly die.

The eighth binding (Witness) was her specific prison: she can exist, but only in disguise. She can interact with the world, but never authentically. She's been alone for a thousand years, wearing masks, never known.

**What she wants:** Dissolution. Not escape, not rebirth — oblivion. She's so tired. The only way to finally end is to break the bindings themselves.

## The Eight Inversions

To break the bindings, Yackle needs living embodiments of each principle's *corruption* — people whose secrets invert the binding. She's been calling these specific eight people for centuries.

---

# PART THREE: THE CHARACTERS

## Character 1: Averic Gulch (The Scholar)
**Binding:** Memory
**Race/Class:** Gillikinese Human, Scholar 5
**Surface Role:** Knowledge, investigation, identifying magical phenomena

### Surface Story
A researcher from Shiz University whose mentor, Professor Ondra Klees, was supposedly connected to Yackle decades ago. Averic claims to have found letters in his mentor's archives suggesting Yackle promised Klees access to her legendary library. He's here to claim what his mentor was owed.

### The Secret (Memory Inversion)
**He forged the letters.** Professor Klees never corresponded with Yackle. Averic created the entire paper trail to justify his obsession with forbidden knowledge. His academic reputation, his reason for being here, his connection to his "mentor's legacy" — all fabricated. He rewrote the past to serve his present.

### Why It Inverts Memory
Memory says the past is real. Averic *created* a false past. He's living proof that history can be fabricated.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Disadvantage on Int saves vs. Yackle. She can counter one of his spells without using a spell slot.

---

## Character 2: Liir Opp (The Heir by Blood)
**Binding:** Blood
**Race/Class:** Gillikinese Human, Soldier 5 (Battle Master)
**Surface Role:** Tank, protector, tactical leadership

### Surface Story
Claims to be a distant descendant of the Ostregas — Yackle's original mortal family from before she became what she is. He has documentation (a family tree, birth records) suggesting his great-grandmother was an illegitimate Ostrega daughter. If true, he's the closest living blood relative to the estate's owner.

### The Secret (Blood Inversion)
**He knows his claim is false.** He discovered years ago that his great-grandmother was adopted into the Ostrega household records fraudulently — a clerk was bribed. There's no Ostrega blood in his veins. He's been knowingly perpetuating the lie because the family name opened doors, got him respect, gave him purpose. He's terrified of being nobody.

### Why It Inverts Blood
Blood says lineage connects and ancestry is fixed. Liir *claims* a lineage that doesn't exist. He's built his identity on false blood.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Yackle has advantage on attacks against him. His attacks against her deal -1d6 damage.

---

## Character 3: Frederick Vawn / Quick-Paw (The Animal in Hiding)
**Binding:** Nature
**Race/Class:** Fox Animal disguised as Munchkinlander Human, Agent 5 (Infiltrator)
**Surface Role:** Scout, infiltrator, skill specialist, lock picking

### Surface Story
A quiet, nervous clerk from Rush Margins who claims Yackle once helped his family during a difficult time. Presents himself as a simple Munchkinlander, speaks with an affected rural accent, keeps his head down.

### The Secret (Nature Inversion)
**He's a Fox.** Capital-A Animal, fully sentient. He's been living as a human for twelve years — forged papers, practiced voice, carefully tailored clothes to hide his tail. Every interaction, every relationship, every moment of his life is a performance of being something he fundamentally is not.

**Secondary Secret:** The Animal underground sent him here. They believe Yackle's library contains information about how Animals were created/awakened — knowledge that could help them. He's on a mission.

### Why It Inverts Nature
Nature says beings are their kind. Frederick IS other than what he appears — a being denying their essential nature every moment of every day.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Yackle can cast *Dominate Person* on him once with no concentration; lasts until he takes damage from her.

---

## Character 4: Sarima Qov (The Debt-Holder)
**Binding:** Sacrifice
**Race/Class:** Arjiki Human, Witch 5 (Pact of the Talisman)
**Surface Role:** Magical utility, control spells, Vinkus cultural knowledge

### Surface Story
A proud Arjiki woman from the Vinkus who claims Yackle swore a blood oath to her grandmother forty years ago. In Arjiki culture, such oaths pass through generations. Yackle owes her family, and Sarima is here to collect.

### The Secret (Sacrifice Inversion)
**Her magic is a transaction, not a gift.** When her younger brother was dying, something answered her desperate plea — but it wasn't charity. It was a *deal*. She traded something — she doesn't know what, exactly — but she feels the weight of it. Sometimes she does things she doesn't remember deciding to do. She tells everyone she's a hereditary witch because the truth terrifies her.

### Why It Inverts Sacrifice
Sacrifice says giving freely creates value. Sarima didn't give — she *traded*. Her power is bought, not gifted.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Yackle can use one of Sarima's pact spell slots. Sarima has disadvantage on concentration saves.

---

## Character 5: Sister Shell (The Former Maunt)
**Binding:** Service
**Race/Class:** Munchkinlander Human, Unionist 5 (Conversion Domain)
**Surface Role:** Primary healer, support caster, moral compass, detecting lies

### Surface Story
A woman who spent fifteen years in a mauntery before leaving suddenly two years ago. She claims she found references to Yackle in the mauntery's archives — specifically, that Yackle donated heavily to the order generations ago, with a stipulation that any "true seeker" who came asking would be welcomed to her estate.

### The Secret (Service Inversion)
**She was expelled for loyalty.** She didn't leave — she was cast out. She discovered the order was complicit in the Animal purges, providing theological justification for atrocities. When she tried to expose them, they silenced her and forced her out. Her faithful service was rewarded with betrayal.

**Secondary Secret:** Despite being expelled and despite knowing the church's crimes, she still has faith. Her powers still work. This confuses and frightens her.

### Why It Inverts Service
Service says duty creates meaning. Shell served faithfully and was *punished* for it. Her service created only exile.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Yackle has resistance to radiant damage. Shell's healing spells heal Yackle for 25% of the amount healed.

---

## Character 6: Madame Viridian / YACKLE (The Widow)
**Binding:** Witness
**Race/Class:** Appears Gillikinese Human, Adept 5 (Divination)
**Surface Role:** Seems helpful, asks questions, encourages bonding

### Surface Story
An elegant older woman, recently widowed. Her husband was a collector of occult artifacts who allegedly did business with Yackle decades ago. She claims Yackle cheated him in a deal, and she's here for restitution.

### The Fake Secret (For Gaining Trust)
Her husband was an art thief. She's been quietly returning stolen pieces, ashamed of his legacy. (This is designed to seem vulnerable and sympathetic — deploy it to build trust.)

### The Truth
**She IS Yackle.** A thousand years old. A shard of the Kumbric Void given will. This is her house. These are her victims. She invited them.

### Why She Fits Witness
Witness says to exist is to be truly seen. Yackle has never been seen. A thousand years of masks. The ultimate inversion — someone who exists only by remaining unknown.

### Instructions for the Witch Player
See separate briefing document (Part Eleven).

---

## Character 7: Captain Mareth Trynn (The Veteran)
**Binding:** Deed
**Race/Class:** Gillikinese Human, Soldier 5 (Champion)
**Surface Role:** Durable tank, voice of experience, self-sacrifice tendencies

### Surface Story
A retired Gale Force captain who served for thirty years. He claims he was once assigned to investigate Yackle's estate during the Wizard's reign. During that time, she gave him something — a token, a promise — and told him he would know when to use it.

### The Secret (Deed Inversion)
**He ordered a massacre.** During the Quadling campaigns, he commanded his unit to kill everyone in a village — not combatants, but farmers, elders, children. The official report said "resistance fighters." He told himself he was following orders, but he wasn't — he was following the *implication* of orders, doing what he knew command wanted without them saying it.

He walked away from that village and kept walking. Kept serving. Kept being "Captain Trynn, decorated officer." The deed should have transformed him into a monster. It didn't. He looks the same as before.

### Why It Inverts Deed
Deed says actions shape the actor. Mareth committed atrocity and remained, outwardly, unchanged. His deed *didn't* define him — an impossibility.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Mareth has disadvantage on attacks against Yackle. If he crits her, it becomes a normal hit instead.

---

## Character 8: Seven (The Tiktok)
**Binding:** Hunger
**Race/Class:** Tiktok Construct, Artisan 5 (Inventor)
**Surface Role:** Trap specialist, repairs, philosophical mirror

### Surface Story
A Tiktok who claims to have been built by Yackle herself. Seven's earliest memories are of this estate, of Yackle's voice, of being wound and set to tasks. When Yackle "died," Seven was sold to a merchant family, passed from owner to owner. They're here because they want to know why they were made. What was their purpose?

### The Secret (Hunger Inversion)
**They feel.** Not simulated responses — actual emotions. Loneliness. Hope. Fear. Curiosity. A Tiktok cannot want; Seven wants. A Tiktok cannot love; Seven thinks they might.

They haven't told anyone because they don't know what it means. Are they a person? Have they always been a person? Have they been *enslaved* their entire existence? The questions are unbearable.

**Secondary Secret:** Their memories of Yackle have been *edited*. Seven is aware there are gaps — moments that should exist but don't. They don't know what was removed or why.

### Why It Inverts Hunger
Hunger says desire drives becoming in living things. Seven isn't alive. They hunger anyway — an impossibility, a machine that wants.

### Combat Weakness (If Secret Collected)
Yackle can force Seven to skip a turn once (bonus action, causes existential system lock). Seven has disadvantage on Wis saves against her.

---

## NPC: Mr. Trism (The Solicitor)

### Appearance
Thin, nervous, possibly mechanical (Tiktok? Or just twitchy?). Wears spectacles. Carries the will in a leather case. Dressed in outdated Gillikinese legal attire — green-tinged waistcoat, high collar.

### What He Knows
- The terms of the will (as written)
- That he's supposed to read it and then wait until dawn
- Very little else — he's a functionary, not a confidant

### What He Doesn't Know
- That Yackle is alive
- That Viridian is Yackle
- What the seals actually do
- Why these specific people were invited

### His Arc
- Hour 1: Professional, nervous, tries to maintain order
- Hour 2: Increasingly frightened as the house turns hostile
- Hour 3: Dies (killed by the house) or revealed as a construct

### Stat Block (If Needed)
**AC** 10 | **HP** 22 | **Speed** 30 ft.
No combat abilities. Will hide or flee.

# PART FOUR: THE SEALS — REVISED STRUCTURE

## The Core Mechanic

The players are told they must unlock all seven seals before dawn. The eighth seal is the Heart Chamber itself — when they confront Yackle in her true form, that binding breaks.

**Important:** Players will likely NOT complete all seven seals before the reveal. The timeline is designed so they'll get 4-5 done before Yackle reveals herself (either by choice or forced by circumstances). This creates tension: do they rush to finish seals, or explore for advantages?

## Individual Rewards
Each seal gives an immediate reward to whoever solves it (or the group):

| Seal | Binding | Individual Reward |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1. Memory | Reconstruct the past | **Reroll Token:** Reroll one failed d20 roll (once) |
| 2. Blood | Prove connection | **Death's Denial:** First time at 0 HP, stabilize automatically |
| 3. Nature | Accept true self | **True Sight Token:** Advantage on one Insight check |
| 4. Service | Answer the call | **Swift Aid:** Help action as bonus action (rest of session) |
| 5. Sacrifice | Give freely | **Last Strike:** When dropped to 0 HP, make one free attack |
| 6. Deed | Acknowledge actions | **Resolve Token:** Reroll one failed saving throw (once) |
| 7. Hunger | not sure yet? come up with something | **Second Wind:** Recover one spent Hit Die |

## The Completion Bonus

**If all seven seals are completed before defeating Yackle, the party gains the Seal Mastery abilities:**

Each completed seal grants a specific power usable against Yackle:

| Seal | Seal Mastery Ability (vs. Yackle) |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| Memory | **Truth of the Past:** Once per battle, force Yackle to reroll an attack or ability check |
| Blood | **Severed Lineage:** Yackle's necrotic damage is reduced by half against you |
| Nature | **True Form:** Yackle cannot use illusion magic or change her appearance |
| Service | **Broken Oath:** Yackle's dominated or charmed creatures can repeat their saves at the start of each turn |
| Sacrifice | **Gift Freely Given:** Healing spells cast on allies within 30 ft. heal an additional 1d6 |
| Deed | **Weight of Action:** Yackle has disadvantage on her first attack each round |
| Hunger | **not sure:** Yackle cannot use legendary actions during the first round of each phase |

**If all seven seals are completed:** Yackle starts Phase 1 at half HP (100 instead of 200).

This creates a strong incentive to complete seals even during the battle if possible (some seals might be completable during Phase 2's chase through the house).

# PART FIVE: THE ESTATE — ROOM BY ROOM

## The Grounds

### The Approach
*Read Aloud:*
> The carriage path winds through overgrown hedges that might once have been sculpted into fanciful shapes — Animals, perhaps, or scenes from Ozian mythology. Now they're just walls of tangled green, pressing close on either side. The fog thickens as you approach, and the temperature drops noticeably. Ahead, iron gates stand open, and beyond them, the manor rises against a bruised purple sky. It's larger than you expected. The architecture is old Gillikinese — all steep gables and narrow windows — but something about the proportions feels wrong. The angles don't quite meet where they should.

**Key Features**

**The Gates.** Wrought iron, standing open. Once a character passes through, they swing shut silently and will not open again by any means. The lock cannot be picked (no DC — simply impossible). A *knock* spell causes the gates to shudder but not open. Attempting to climb over results in the character finding themselves back on the inside.

**The Hedges.** A DC 14 Nature check reveals these were once shaped like Animals — Lions, Bears, a great Eagle. Now they're wild, but the shapes are still vaguely visible if you know to look.

**The Fog.** Extends about 20 feet beyond the walls. A character who enters the fog must make a DC 15 Constitution save each round or begin suffocating. After three failed saves, they fall unconscious and are expelled back onto the estate grounds.

---

### The Cemetery
*Read Aloud:*
> A low iron fence surrounds a small family plot to the west of the main house. The headstones are old — some cracked, some sunken into the earth — but the names are still legible. OSTREGA, they all read. Generations of them. The newest stone looks perhaps a century old. There are fresh flowers on one grave, impossibly fresh, as if placed this morning. But no one has lived here in decades.

**Key Features**

**The Headstones.** The Ostrega family burial plot. A DC 12 History check reveals the Ostregas were a minor Gillikinese family who died out about a century ago — no living descendants. Liir's player may find this concerning.

**The Fresh Flowers.** On the grave of "Yael Ostrega, Beloved Daughter." A DC 14 Investigation check finds that the flowers are real but have no roots — they're simply placed here. A DC 16 Arcana check reveals faint necromantic magic. Someone has been maintaining this grave.

**HANDOUT: Gravestone Rubbing.** If a character makes a rubbing of any headstone, provide a physical handout showing the Ostrega family crest (a key crossed with a quill) and dates spanning from 600s to 900s OZ calendar.

---

## Ground Floor

### 1. The Foyer
*Read Aloud:*
> The front doors open onto a grand entrance hall. A crystal chandelier hangs overhead, unlit, its hundreds of pendants catching what little moonlight filters through the high windows. A sweeping staircase curves upward to the left, while doorways lead off in three directions. The floor is checkered marble — green and white — worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. A grandfather clock stands against the far wall, its pendulum still. In the center of the room, someone has arranged eight chairs in a circle around a small table bearing a single leather case.

**Key Features**

**The Chandelier.** If a character looks closely (Perception DC 12), they notice the crystals are not glass but some kind of green stone. A DC 15 Arcana check identifies them as emeralds — a fortune's worth. However, any attempt to remove them causes them to crumble to worthless powder.

**The Grandfather Clock.** The clock shows 11:47 — always 11:47, regardless of the actual time. It has no visible winding mechanism. At midnight (real time, or when dramatically appropriate), it chimes thirteen times. This signals the First Twist.

**The Chairs.** Eight chairs, each with a name card on the seat. The names are not the characters' names but epithets:
- "The One Who Rewrote the Past"
- "The One Who Claims False Blood"  
- "The One Who Denies Their Nature"
- "The One Whose Service Was Punished"
- "The One Who Traded Instead of Gave"
- "The One Whose Deed Did Not Transform Them"
- "The One Who Hungers When They Should Not"
- "The One Who Has Never Been Seen"

**HANDOUT: The Place Cards.** Provide physical cards with these epithets. Let players figure out which card belongs to whom.

**The Leather Case.** Contains the will. Mr. Trism will open it and read it when all eight heirs are present.

**The Staircase.** Leads to the upper floors. Until the First Twist, the stairs seem to go on forever — characters who climb find themselves back at the bottom. After the clock chimes, the upper floors become accessible.

---

### 2. The Parlor
*Read Aloud:*
> A comfortable sitting room with faded elegance. Two sofas face each other across a low table, upholstered in purple velvet worn thin at the armrests. A fireplace dominates one wall — cold now, but logs are laid ready to burn. Above the mantle hangs a portrait of a woman in old-fashioned dress, her face obscured by a crack in the canvas that runs directly through her features. Against the far wall, a drinks cabinet stands open, bottles of amber and crimson liquid glinting in the low light. A chess board sits on a side table, mid-game.

**Key Features**

**The Fireplace.** If anyone expresses a desire for warmth (verbal or otherwise), the fire ignites itself without fuel or spark. This is the first sign the house responds to its occupants. The fire provides normal warmth and light but cannot be used to burn anything — objects placed in it simply sit there, unharmed.

**The Portrait.** Originally depicted Yackle in her mortal days. The crack appeared when she was first bound. A DC 16 Investigation check around the frame reveals a small plaque, nearly painted over: "Y.O., Age 23." A *mending* spell repairs the crack but reveals only a blank face — smooth, featureless, like an unfinished painting.

**The Drinks Cabinet.** Contains wine and spirits that are safe to consume. A DC 14 Investigation check finds a hidden compartment containing a small vial labeled "For When It Becomes Too Much" — this is a *potion of dreamless sleep* (8 hours of unconsciousness, no dreams, no external force can wake the drinker).

**The Chess Game.** Mid-game, white is winning. A DC 12 Intelligence check recognizes it as a famous historical match — the "Ozma Gambit," supposedly played between Queen Ozma and the first Wizard. The game was never finished; Ozma disappeared before the final move. The white queen is positioned to checkmate in one move.

**HANDOUT: The Ozma Gambit.** A note tucked under the chess board explaining the game's history. The final move was never made. Someone has written in the margin: *"She always knew how to win. She just chose not to."*

---

### 3. The Music Room (SEAL 1: MEMORY)
*Read Aloud:*
> Instruments line the walls of this circular room — a harp with broken strings, a violin in a glass case, a set of Quadling drums. Dominating the space is a grand piano, its lid open, keys yellowed with age. Sheet music is scattered across every surface: the piano bench, the floor, tucked into instrument cases. A mechanical music box sits on a pedestal near the window, ornate and clearly valuable. The moonlight catches something written in silver ink on the music box's lid.

**Key Features**

**The Piano.** Playable, though out of tune. A DC 12 Performance check can coax a recognizable melody from it. Playing the correct melody (see Seal puzzle below) causes the lid of the music box to open.

**The Sheet Music.** Scattered fragments of what was once a single composition. A DC 14 Investigation check, taking 10 minutes, can gather all the pieces. A DC 12 Intelligence check (or proficiency in a musical instrument) can arrange them in the correct order.

**The Music Box.** The lid reads "O, To Be Known" in silver script. The box is locked (or rather, sealed). Inside is a **shard of green crystal** that hums faintly with magic — this is a **Memory Shard**, useful in the final battle (see Part Seven).

**HANDOUT: Sheet Music Fragments.** Provide 4-5 physical pieces of paper with musical notation. On each piece, certain notes are circled or highlighted. When arranged correctly, the highlighted notes spell out "REMEMBER" in musical notation (each note corresponds to a letter: R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R).

**SEAL OF MEMORY PUZZLE**

To break the seal:
1. Find all sheet music fragments (scattered in Music Room, Parlor, and Foyer)
2. Arrange them in correct order (Intelligence DC 12)
3. Play the melody on the piano (Performance DC 10, or any character with instrument proficiency)

**Reward:** One character gains a **Reroll Token** (reroll one failed d20, once).

---

### 4. The Library (SEAL 3: NATURE)
*Read Aloud:*
> Floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books of every size and age. The smell of old paper and leather hangs heavy in the air. A rolling ladder leans against one shelf, its wheels rusted in place. Reading desks are positioned throughout — one holds an open journal, another a magnifying glass and a collection of specimen jars. The jars contain preserved creatures: a bird, a mouse, a snake, each floating in amber liquid. There's something unsettling about their eyes.

**Key Features**

**The Books.** Thousands of volumes on every subject. A character who searches for specific information can make an Investigation check:
- DC 12: Find general information about Ozian history, geography, or magic
- DC 15: Find references to "The Eight Bindings" or "Lurline's Words"
- DC 18: Find Yackle's personal journals (see below)

**Yackle's Journals.** Scattered throughout the library, spanning centuries. Each is written in the same handwriting. A DC 14 Investigation check finds three journals from different eras. A DC 16 History check recognizes the dates span over 600 years — impossibly long for any mortal.

**HANDOUT: Journal Excerpts.** Three physical pages:

*Journal 1 (Year 347 OZ):*
> "The fairy spoke Eight Words, and the chaos took shape. I remember the first word. It was REMEMBER. And suddenly there was a past, where before there had been only the eternal present..."

*Journal 2 (Year 612 OZ):*
> "I have tried to die. The knife turned aside. The poison became water in my throat. The fall ended in soft landing. I cannot unmake myself. The Binding of Witness holds: I exist because I am unseen. If anyone truly SAW me, perhaps..."

*Journal 3 (Year 901 OZ):*
> "What do I want? I want to... I cannot write it. The word starts with L and ends with everything."

**The Specimen Jars.** Eight jars containing preserved creatures. A DC 14 Nature or Insight check reveals that four of them are Animals (capital A, sentient) and four are animals (lowercase, ordinary). The Animals are preserved in positions of dignity — eyes closed, peaceful. The animals are posed more carelessly.

**SEAL OF NATURE PUZZLE**

To break the seal:
1. Examine the specimen jars carefully
2. Correctly identify which four are Animals and which four are animals (Nature DC 13, or Insight DC 14)
3. Speak the Animals' names aloud (written on tiny labels on the jar bases, nearly invisible: "Whisper the Wren," "Councillor Burroughs," "Poet Sleen," "Ambassador Kinderly")

Frederick has advantage on this check but doing so risks drawing attention to his unusual knowledge.

**Reward:** One character gains a **True Sight Token** (advantage on one Insight check, once).

---

### 5. The Chapel (SEAL 5: SACRIFICE)
*Read Aloud:*
> Eight stained glass windows line the walls of this small chapel, each depicting a different scene in brilliant colors that glow despite the darkness outside. Wooden pews face a simple altar of white stone. Above the altar, instead of a symbol, there is only a blank space — a deliberate emptiness. An offering bowl sits on the altar's surface, tarnished silver, empty. The air smells faintly of incense that hasn't burned in decades.

**Key Features**

**The Stained Glass Windows.** Eight windows, each depicting one of Lurline's Bindings (though they're not labeled as such). A DC 12 Religion check recognizes the imagery as Lurlinite, predating Unionist tradition. A DC 16 Religion check can identify each Binding by its depiction:
1. Memory: A river flowing from past to future
2. Blood: A tree with intertwining roots
3. Nature: A creature looking in a mirror, seeing itself
4. Service: A kneeling figure receiving a crown
5. Sacrifice: An open hand releasing a bird
6. Deed: A figure walking, leaving footprints that become flowers (or thorns)
7. Hunger: A flame that illuminates rather than consumes
8. Witness: An eye, open, seeing a small figure

**HANDOUT: The Eight Windows.** A sketched diagram of the eight windows with brief descriptions. Players can use this to piece together the Bindings' meanings.

**The Blank Space.** Where Unionists would place the symbol of the Unnamed God, there is nothing. A DC 14 Religion check understands this is deliberate — in the oldest traditions, the divine was not depicted at all. Below the blank space, carved into the wall: *"The Unnamed God sees all. But VOICE is what the unseen crave most."*

**The Offering Bowl.** Silver, tarnished. To break the seal, someone must place something of genuine value in the bowl — not gold or gems, but something personally meaningful. A lock of hair from a loved one. A letter never sent. A memento of something lost.

**SEAL OF SACRIFICE PUZZLE**

To break the seal:
1. Place something of genuine personal value in the offering bowl
2. The DM judges sincerity — token offerings are rejected (the bowl tips them out)
3. When a genuine sacrifice is made, the bowl glows briefly and the offering disappears

What counts as genuine:
- A physical item with emotional significance
- A spoken secret (freely given, not coerced)
- A drop of blood given willingly (1 HP, non-healing for 1 hour)
- A promise that binds

**Reward:** One character gains **Last Strike** (when dropped to 0 HP, make one free attack).

---

### 6. The Dining Room (SEAL 7: HUNGER — THE TRAP)
*Read Aloud:*
> A long table dominates this room, set for eight with fine china and tarnished silver. Candelabras line the center of the table, their candles unlit. Each place setting has a name card — not names, but descriptions. The chair at the head of the table is larger than the others, throne-like, and conspicuously empty. A sideboard against the wall holds covered dishes that steam gently, as if dinner was just served. The smell of food is overwhelming — rich, savory, impossible to identify.

**Key Features**

**The Table.** Set for eight, with name cards matching the epithets from the Foyer. An empty ninth place at the head. If characters sit in their "correct" seats (matching their epithet), the candles light themselves.

**The Food.** The covered dishes contain whatever food the character lifting the lid most desires — their favorite meal, comfort food from childhood, something they've been craving. It's real and safe to eat. But it never runs out, no matter how much is consumed. A DC 14 Arcana check reveals this is a form of conjuration magic, but the source is unclear.

**The Empty Chair.** Larger, older than the others. No name card. A DC 15 Investigation check finds something carved into the armrest, very small: *"For when someone finally stays."*

**SEAL OF HUNGER PUZZLE **

This seal cannot be completed until all characters are seated. Then:

this should be thought out

**Reward:** One character gains **Second Wind** (recover one spent Hit Die).

### 7. The Kitchen
*Read Aloud:*
> Copper pots hang from ceiling hooks, green with age. A massive hearth dominates one wall, cold and dark, with an iron spit large enough to roast a whole pig. Preparation tables are scarred by a century of knife work. A pantry door stands ajar, revealing shelves that might or might not have food. Near the back, a heavy door is set into the floor — the entrance to the cellar, chained shut with a massive padlock.

**Key Features**

**The Hearth.** Unlike the parlor fireplace, this one doesn't light itself. However, if fire is brought here, it burns unusually well — anything cooked in this hearth provides an additional 1d6 temporary HP for 1 hour.

**The Pantry.** Empty when one person enters. When multiple people enter together, they find it fully stocked with fresh food — bread still warm, fruit at perfect ripeness, meat freshly cut. The house feeds groups, not individuals.

**The Cellar Door.** Chained and padlocked. The key does not exist within the house (it's in the puzzle box). A DC 20 Strength check can break the chain. A DC 18 Thieves' Tools check can pick the padlock. A *knock* spell opens both chain and padlock. Until the First Twist, the door won't open by any means — the house isn't ready to show what's below.

**HANDOUT: Recipe Card.** Found tucked behind a pot:
> "For the Long Night:
> One cup of patience
> Two measures of truth  
> A pinch of memory (your own)
> Stir widdershins until the past dissolves
> 
> Serve cold. Makes enough for everyone who matters.
> 
> —Y.O."

### 8. The Servant Quarters (SEAL 4: SERVICE — Part 1)
*Read Aloud:*
> A row of small beds lines one wall, each neatly made with threadbare blankets. Hooks on the wall hold uniforms — maid's dresses, butler's coats, all in the same faded green. A duty roster is pinned to a board near the door, listing tasks and names in neat columns. Personal effects sit on small shelves beside each bed: a comb, a prayer book, a child's drawing. The room feels lived in, but there's no dust. Someone has been maintaining this.

**Key Features**

**The Beds.** Six beds, all made. The blankets are cold, but if a character lies down, they hear whispered voices — fragments of conversation, laughter, crying. A DC 14 Perception check distinguishes the words: "...another one tonight..." "...she's kinder than the stories say..." "...do you think she knows she's alone?"

**The Duty Roster.** Lists tasks and names: Mira, Cook. Willem, Butler. Tess, Maid. And so on. The handwriting is consistent throughout the roster, but the dates span decades. A DC 14 Investigation check notices that some tasks are marked "Still Pending" — tasks assigned to servants who died centuries ago.

**The Bell Board.** A row of bells, each labeled with a room: Library, Parlor, Chapel, Master Bedroom, etc. One bell is stuck in the "rung" position: the Memorial Room (upstairs). It makes no sound, but it never stops trembling.

**SEAL OF SERVICE PUZZLE (Part 1)**

This seal requires two steps:
1. Notice the stuck bell (Perception DC 11)
2. Go to the Memorial Room (upstairs) and perform the required service

The seal completes in the Memorial Room (see that entry).

---

### 9. The Greenhouse
*Read Aloud:*
> Glass walls and ceiling, though the glass is so old and thick it's nearly green. Moonlight filters through, casting everything in an underwater glow. Plants from every region of Oz grow here in defiance of nature — Gillikinese orchids beside Quadling marsh-lotus beside Vinkus cacti. Some of the plants shouldn't be able to exist together; their climate needs are completely incompatible. In the center of the room, a potting bench holds dead flowers arranged in a pattern. Most have crumbled, but one letter remains clearly visible: E.

**Key Features**

**The Impossible Garden.** Plants from all four corners of Oz, growing together. A DC 13 Nature check confirms this should be impossible — these plants need radically different conditions. A DC 16 Arcana check detects faint transmutation magic sustaining them.

**The Dead Flowers.** Someone arranged these to spell a word. Time has destroyed most of them, but the E is clear. Nearby, a note in spidery handwriting: *"I tried to grow something that would last. Everything ends."*

**HANDOUT: The Note.** Physical paper with the quoted text.

**The Responsive Plants.** If a character is genuinely emotionally vulnerable here (shares a real feeling, admits fear, shows sadness), one plant blooms for them. The flower lasts one hour outside the greenhouse. Any character carrying such a flower gains advantage on one Charisma check before it wilts.

**The Mural.** On one glass panel, someone has scratched a scene: a woman (Yackle?) planting something, with the word "HOPE" written beneath. It's been crossed out. Below the crossing-out: "WAIT."

---

## Upper Floors

### 10. The Portrait Gallery (SEAL 2: BLOOD)
*Read Aloud:*
> Family portraits line both walls of this long gallery, dozens of faces staring down at you. The Ostregas, according to the plaques — generations of them, spanning centuries. Some portraits are formal, posed. Others seem almost candid: a child playing, a woman reading, a man looking out a window at something unseen. One portrait, larger than the others, hangs at the far end of the gallery. It shows a young woman with faintly green-tinged skin and eyes that seem to follow you. The frame is cracked, and someone has carved a single letter into it: "I."

**Key Features**

**The Family Portraits.** The Ostrega family across generations. A DC 14 Perception check notices something strange: the same face appears in multiple portraits across different eras. Same eyes, same bone structure, despite supposedly being different people.

**The Family Tree.** Painted on one wall: a sprawling family tree of the Ostregas. Several branches are marked "Ended" with dates. One branch leads off the wall entirely, as if continuing somewhere unseen. A DC 14 Investigation check finds small portrait miniatures in frames around the room — they need to be placed in the empty slots on the family tree.

**The Large Portrait.** Yackle, age 23, before her transformation. Her skin is slightly green (Quadling heritage? something else?), her expression hopeful. The frame reads "Y.O." and has "I" carved roughly into the wood. This is one of the puzzle box clues.

**HANDOUT: Ostrega Family Tree (Incomplete).** A diagram of the family tree with several empty slots. Provide small portrait miniatures (or cards representing them) to be placed.

**SEAL OF BLOOD PUZZLE**

To break the seal:
1. Find the portrait miniatures (scattered in this room and the Master Bedroom)
2. Place them correctly in the family tree based on clues in the paintings (clothing, jewelry, background details)
3. Investigation DC 14, or automatic with 15+ minutes of careful study

The final slot leads off the wall. When all other miniatures are placed, the wall swings open to reveal a hidden alcove containing: a **locket with no portrait inside**, and a note: *"I had no one to put here. Does that mean I never existed?"*

**Reward:** One character gains **Death's Denial** (first time at 0 HP, stabilize automatically).

---

### 11. The Memorial Room (SEAL 4: SERVICE — Part 2)
*Read Aloud:*
> A solemn space with walls lined in dark wood. Bronze plaques cover every surface, each bearing a name and dates. An eternal flame burns blue in a brazier at the room's center, casting strange shadows. A guest book lies open on a pedestal, and beside it, a single unlit candle. The most recent plaque is tarnished less than the others. It reads: "Visitor 147. Came Seeking Knowledge. 903 OZ."

**Key Features**

**The Plaques.** Previous "heirs" — everyone who came before, answered the call, tried to claim the inheritance. None of them left. Names, dates, and brief descriptions: "Came Seeking Power." "Came Seeking Revenge." "Came Seeking Truth." A DC 12 Investigation check counts approximately 150 plaques spanning 600+ years.

**HANDOUT: The Names of the Lost.** A partial list of names and dates from the plaques. If a character reads these aloud respectfully, they gain the **Inspiration of the Fallen** ability (see Part Seven).

**The Blue Flame.** Cannot be extinguished by any means. Provides dim light. If a character touches it, they feel a moment of profound peace — not painful, but melancholy.

**The Guest Book.** Visitors who came before signed this book. The entries grow more desperate over time. The last entry: *"I understand now. She isn't the monster. She's the cage. —V. Tallis, 903"*

**The Unlit Candle.** This is what the stuck bell was calling for. To complete the Seal of Service:

**SEAL OF SERVICE PUZZLE (Part 2)**

To break the seal:
1. Light the candle from the blue flame
2. Speak the names of at least three previous visitors (from the plaques)
3. The service required was simple: remember them. Acknowledge they existed.

When completed, the blue flame burns brighter for a moment, and a whispered voice says: *"Thank you."*

**Reward:** One character gains **Swift Aid** (Help action as bonus action for rest of session).

---

### 12. The Master Bedroom
*Read Aloud:*
> A four-poster bed dominates this room, its curtains drawn closed. A vanity mirror sits against one wall, its surface clouded with age. A wardrobe stands open, revealing clothes from different eras — current Gillikinese fashion hanging next to styles from a century ago, and beside those, garments that look positively ancient. A writing desk sits near the window, its surface covered in papers and a single letter that seems to have been started and never finished.

**Key Features**

**The Bed.** The curtains are drawn. If pulled back, the bed is empty but clearly slept in — recently. The sheets are still warm. A DC 14 Perception check finds a single long gray hair on the pillow.

**The Vanity Mirror.** Clouded, but functional. If a character looks into it at midnight specifically, they see Yackle's true reflection: ancient, gray-green skin, tired eyes. She's watching them. The reflection mouths words: *"Can you see me?"*

**The Wardrobe.** Clothes spanning centuries, all the same size. Hidden in the back (Investigation DC 14), a portrait miniature needed for the Blood seal and a small jewelry box containing: a **ring of protection** and a note reading *"For the one who stays."*

**The Writing Desk.** Covered in papers. The unfinished letter reads:

**HANDOUT: The Unfinished Letter.**
> "If anyone ever reads this — I want U to know I was here. I existed. I mattered.
> 
> I have worn so many faces. Been called so many names. None of them were mine. None of them were ME.
> 
> What is a person if no one knows them? What is existence without witness?
> 
> I think the word for what I want is L—"

The letter ends there. The "U" in "you" is circled obsessively, dozens of times.

---

### 13. Guest Room 1 — The Scholar's Room
*Read Aloud:*
> Books everywhere — on shelves, on the floor, stacked on the bed. A desk is buried under papers. Everything speaks to obsessive study. But something is wrong with the books. The titles are... accusatory. "The Art of Falsification." "Lies Told by Historians." "How to Forge a Legacy." On the desk, a magnifying glass sits atop an open book titled "The Forger's Confession."

**Key Features**

**The Books.** Specifically targeted at Averic. None of these books exist in real Oz — the house created them. A DC 14 Arcana check confirms they're illusory, manifestations of the room's magic.

**The Forger's Confession.** Opens to a page describing, in excruciating detail, how to forge academic documents. If Averic reads it, he must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or be shaken (disadvantage on the next check or save).

**The Hidden Item.** Under the pillow: a **quill that never lies**. Any document written with this quill cannot contain falsehoods (the ink refuses to form lying words). Potentially useful, but also dangerous for someone with secrets.

---

### 14. Guest Room 2 — The Soldier's Room
*Read Aloud:*
> Military precision. The bed is made with hospital corners. Boots are lined up at the foot. A uniform hangs in the closet — Gale Force dress greens, captain's insignia. Medal boxes are displayed on a dresser. But on the wall, where commendations might hang, there are children's drawings. Stick figures. Houses. A sun. The paper is old and water-damaged, as if someone tried to destroy them and then changed their mind.

**Key Features**

**The Uniform.** Mareth's (or a duplicate of his). The medals are for campaigns in Quadling Country. A DC 12 History check identifies specific battles — some of which were later revealed to be civilian massacres.

**The Children's Drawings.** From the village. Trophies, or guilt objects? A DC 14 Insight check suggests the latter — these weren't taken in triumph. They were taken to remember. To not forget what was done.

**The Hidden Item.** In the uniform pocket: a **letter of commendation** for "decisive action in clearing hostile territory." It's signed by a general whose name was later disgraced for war crimes. The letter is evidence of what happened, if anyone wanted to bring it to light.

---

### 15. Guest Room 3 — The Animal's Room
*Read Aloud:*
> A simple room, but the mirror on the wall is wrong. It doesn't show your reflection — it shows something else. Something with a pointed snout. Something with fur. The bed has claw marks on the posts, and the window is barred from the inside, as if someone wanted to make sure they couldn't get out.

**Key Features**

**The Mirror.** Shows Frederick's true form, regardless of who looks into it. If Frederick looks, he sees himself as the Fox he is. If someone else looks, they see a fox standing where Frederick should be. The effect lasts only for this room.

**The Claw Marks.** On the bed posts and the windowsill. Made by an Animal in distress. How long ago? Impossible to tell.

**The Bars.** On the inside of the window. Someone locked themselves IN, not out. Under the window, scratched into the wood: *"They'll find me. They always find us."*

**The Hidden Item.** Under a loose floorboard (Investigation DC 15): **forged papers** for someone named "Brush Tanner" — clearly Animal papers, creating a false human identity. The forgery is masterful. The papers include a note: *"The underground never forgets its friends. —B."*

---

### 16. The Nursery
*Read Aloud:*
> A child's room, preserved in amber. Toys arranged on shelves. A rocking horse stands in one corner, frozen mid-rock. Picture books are stacked on a small table. A tiny bed with a canopy, and sitting on the bed, a doll that looks almost like a real child. No — wait. The doll is looking at you. It blinked.

This is not a doll. This is the **Ghost Child**.

**Key Features**

**The Ghost Child.** Name is Holly. She's been dead for 300 years but doesn't entirely understand this. She appears to be about six years old, translucent, wearing a nightgown. She's lonely. She wants someone to play with.

**Interacting with Holly:**
- She speaks in a child's simple way but knows things she shouldn't
- She calls Yackle "the lady who changes" and says she's been here "forever"
- She doesn't understand she's dead — she thinks she's waiting for her mother
- She cannot leave the nursery

**What Holly Knows:**
- "The lady changes faces but she's always the same underneath"
- "The house loves her but she doesn't love it back"
- "Everyone leaves eventually. Usually down." (gestures toward the floor — the cellar)
- "There are words that hurt her. Old words. From before."

**EARNING GUIDANCE OF THE HOUSE:**
If a player engages kindly with Holly — plays with her, reads her a story, treats her like a person — they earn:

**Guidance of the House:** Bonus action: Grant a d4 to an ally's next ability check. Unlimited uses.

Holly will occasionally whisper warnings to this character for the rest of the session.

---

### 17. Yackle's Study
*Read Aloud:*
> This room is different. The dust is disturbed. Someone has been here recently. A desk is covered in star charts, astronomical calculations, and pages of dense text in a language that shifts when you try to read it. Bookshelves hold journals and ledgers. A telescope points out the window at the sky. And on one shelf, in a place of honor, sits an ornate puzzle box covered in strange symbols.

**Key Features**

**The Star Charts.** Depict constellations that don't exist in Oz's sky. A DC 16 Arcana check identifies them as depicting the Kumbric Void — what existed before Lurline made the world.

**The Shifting Text.** Grimmerie pages, fragments only. Attempting to read them requires a DC 18 Intelligence check; failure results in 1d4 psychic damage and the unsettling feeling that the pages read YOU.

**The Journals.** More of Yackle's journals. These are more recent — the last 50 years or so. They describe her preparations, her searches for the right "heirs," her growing desperation.

**HANDOUT: Recent Journal Entry.**
> "Year 954. I have found them. Finally, after so long.
> 
> The scholar who fabricates. The soldier who claims false blood. The fox who wears human skin. The maunt whose service was punished. The Arjiki who traded instead of gave. The soldier whose deed did not transform him. The machine that hungers.
> 
> Seven inversions. Seven keys.
> 
> I will wear the face of a widow. I will walk among them. I will make them trust me.
> 
> And when they have given me their truths, freely spoken — I will finally, finally stop."

**The Puzzle Box.** The ILOVEU puzzle box. Ornate, covered in symbols. The symbols are the eight binding words (see Chapel windows). To open it, enter the code on the physical puzzle box prop.

**Inside the Puzzle Box:**
- A **map** showing the location of the Heart Chamber (behind the cellar wall)
- A **portrait miniature** of Yackle's true face — young, hopeful, green-tinged
- A **note**: *"If you found this, you looked. That's more than anyone has done in a thousand years."*
- **Lurline's Word** — a shard of green crystal inscribed with the word "REMEMBER"

**EARNING LURLINE'S WORD:**
Once during battle, speak the Word to deal 4d10 radiant damage to Yackle (no save).

**EARNING FLASH OF GENIUS:**
The player who figures out the puzzle box code gains:

**Flash of Genius:** Reaction: Add +5 to any ability check or saving throw within 30 ft. 3 uses total.

---

### 18. The Observatory
*Read Aloud:*
> The ceiling is domed glass, offering an unobstructed view of the night sky. But the stars aren't right. They're too bright, too close, and they're moving in patterns that make your head hurt if you watch too long. A massive telescope dominates the room, pointed at something specific. An orrery — a mechanical model of celestial bodies — sits on a pedestal, but its planets are unfamiliar shapes. An hourglass on a shelf shows sand falling, but you can't tell how much remains.

**Key Features**

**The Telescope.** Points at the Kumbric Void — the space between stars where reality isn't quite real. Looking through it requires a DC 14 Wisdom save. On failure: 1d6 psychic damage and the character is shaken. On success: The character sees shapes moving in the void — things that existed before Oz. One of them turns and looks back. (This is narratively disturbing but provides no mechanical benefit.)

**The Orrery.** Shows celestial bodies that shouldn't exist. Eight planets (not Oz's actual astronomy), each inscribed with one of the binding words. A DC 15 Arcana check can identify this as a model of Lurline's original cosmological ordering — the conceptual structure underlying reality.

**The Hourglass.** Shows how long until dawn — and the end of the adventure. If the DM wants to make time pressure visible, use this. The sand falls faster when the players are idle.

---

### 19. The Hall of Mirrors (SEAL 6: DEED)
*Read Aloud:*
> Mirrors line both walls of this long corridor, dozens of them in ornate frames. But they don't reflect what's in front of them — or rather, they don't reflect it correctly. One mirror shows you younger. Another shows you older. One shows you in different clothes. One shows nothing at all, just empty glass. And as you walk down the hall, you begin to see things in the mirrors that haven't happened yet. Or things that have happened and you'd rather forget.

**Key Features**

**The Mirrors.** Each shows a different version of the character looking into it:
- One shows the character at their happiest
- One shows them at their most ashamed
- One shows what they might become
- One shows what they're afraid of becoming
- One shows their death (shadowy, unclear, disturbing)
- One shows nothing (the character has no reflection — deeply unsettling)

**The True Mirror.** At the end of the hall, larger than the others. This mirror shows what the character has DONE. Not what they look like, not what they might be — what they've actually done in their life. The images are not kind.

**SEAL OF DEED PUZZLE**

To break the seal:
1. Each character who walks through sees their actions reflected
2. To complete the seal, ONE character must stand before the True Mirror and say, aloud: *"That is me. I did that."*
3. Acknowledging their deeds — not excusing them, not explaining them, but accepting them

This is hardest for Mareth, who must acknowledge the massacre. But any character can complete the seal by acknowledging their own actions.

When the seal breaks, all the mirrors shatter simultaneously. In the silence, a whispered voice: *"Finally. Someone took responsibility."*

**Reward:** One character gains a **Resolve Token** (reroll one failed saving throw, once).

---

## The Cellar

### 20. The Wine Cellar
*Read Aloud:*
> The stairs descend into darkness, the temperature dropping as you go. The wine cellar is vast — rows of barrels and racks of bottles extending into the shadows. The smell is wrong, though. Not wine. Something sharper. Something organic. The labels on the barrels aren't years or vintages. They're names.

**Key Features**

**The Barrels.** Labeled with names, not dates. A DC 12 Investigation check confirms these are names from the Memorial Room — previous heirs. The barrels do not contain wine. A DC 14 Constitution save to avoid retching when this is realized.

**The Wine Racks.** Some actual wine bottles here, perfectly preserved. One bottle, older than the others, is labeled "For the End." It contains a single dose of **potion of invulnerability** (resistance to all damage for 1 hour). Was Yackle saving this for someone? Herself?

**The Hidden Door.** Behind a rack of barrels (Investigation DC 18 without the map, automatic with the map from the puzzle box): a false wall that leads to the Heart Chamber.

---

### 21. The Main Cellar
*Read Aloud:*
> Beyond the wine cellar, the space opens into a larger chamber with stone walls older than the house above. Old furniture is piled here, draped in canvas — chairs, tables, a broken bed frame. Crates of books and papers are stacked against the walls. The air is thick and tastes of copper. Against the far wall, hidden behind furniture, the stones are slightly different — newer, or perhaps just disturbed.

**Key Features**

**The Furniture.** From different eras, accumulated over centuries. A DC 14 Investigation check finds personal items from previous heirs tucked into the furniture: a locket, a journal, a military badge.

**HANDOUT: Previous Heir's Journal.**
> "Day 3 in the house. We've nearly completed all the seals. Lady Veena says she can feel the magic weakening. She's certain we'll claim the inheritance by dawn.
> 
> Day 4. Dawn came. We didn't leave. The doors won't open. Something is wrong with the widow. She's been acting strange since the last seal. Watching us.
> 
> Day 5. The widow isn't the widow. We were fools. She was here all along. She IS the inheritance. She IS the house.
> 
> Day 6. Running out of"
> 
> (The journal ends mid-sentence.)

**The False Wall.** The map shows exactly where to look. Without the map: Investigation DC 18 to find the seams. With the map: automatic. The stones can be pushed aside to reveal a dark passage.

---

### 22. The Heart Chamber
*Read Aloud:*
> The passage opens into a circular room that pulses. The walls are stone, but they move — slowly, rhythmically, like breathing. In the center of the room, suspended by threads of shadow that connect to three points on the walls, is a figure. Ancient. Withered. Eyes closed. Green-gray skin stretched over bones like parchment. This is Yackle's original body — what she was before a thousand years of masks and lies.
> 
> The threads of shadow pulse with each breath of the walls. This is the heart of the house. This is what you've been searching for.
> 
> This is where it ends.

**Key Features**

**The Body.** Yackle's original form, sustained by magic for over a thousand years. Not dead, not alive — suspended. When Yackle reveals herself and the battle begins, this is where Phase 3 occurs. Her consciousness returns here when the house-form is driven out.

**The Anchor Points.** Three glowing nodes where shadow-threads connect to the walls. To truly defeat Yackle, these must be destroyed:
- **AC:** 12
- **HP:** 30 each
- **Immune to:** Necrotic, psychic

Destroying an anchor deals 20 damage to Yackle and permanently reduces her legendary actions by 1. She can use her reaction to make a Void Touch attack against whoever destroyed it.

**The Walls.** Breathing. Watching. The house itself, concentrated here. During Phase 3, lair actions originate from these walls.

**The Eighth Seal.** This chamber IS the eighth seal — the Seal of Witness. When Yackle is finally seen (truly seen, in her real form, in her real place), the eighth binding breaks. This happens automatically when the players reach this room during the final battle.

---

# PART EIGHT: THE SECRET COLLECTION

## How It Works
When a character reveals their secret **in the presence of Yackle/Viridian**, she collects that inversion. The Yackle player marks it secretly.

## What Yackle Gains Per Secret (Pre-Reveal)

| Character | Yackle's Combat Benefit |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Averic | Disadvantage on Int saves; counter one spell free |
| Liir | Advantage on attacks vs. him; his damage -1d6 |
| Frederick | *Dominate Person* once, no concentration |
| Shell | Resistance to radiant; Shell's heals also heal Yackle 25% |
| Sarima | Use one of Sarima's spell slots; Sarima disadvantage on concentration |
| Mareth | Disadvantage on attacks vs. her; crits become normal hits |
| Seven | Skip Seven's turn once; Seven disadvantage on Wis saves |

## Extraction During Combat
**Kumbric Extraction** (Action, Recharge 5-6)
Target within 60 ft. makes DC 16 Wisdom save. Failure: 4d8 psychic damage, speak secret aloud, Yackle collects it.
Success: Half damage, resist extraction.

**Immunity:** Characters who revealed voluntarily are immune.
