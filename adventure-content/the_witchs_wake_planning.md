# The Witch's Wake — Complete Planning Document
## A 4-Hour D&D 5e One-Shot Set in Gregory Maguire's Oz

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Title:** The Witch's Wake
**System:** D&D 5e
**Duration:** 4 hours
**Players:** 4-6
**Experience Level:** Mixed (some veterans, some newbies)
**Setting:** Gregory Maguire's Oz universe (Wicked series)
**Tone:** Gothic mystery, intrigue, awe, wonder, and horror — similar to Haunting of Hill House
**Core Hook:** One player is secretly the witch Yackle, hidden among the heirs, working to kill them all

---

# THE PREMISE

## The Setup (What Players Know)
Six strangers receive letters claiming they are named in the will of **Yackle Ostreaga**, a legendary witch thought long dead. They arrive at her remote estate in the Pertha Hills of Gillikin. A solicitor named **Mr. Trism** explains that the inheritance is vast — magical artifacts, property, forbidden knowledge — but Yackle's will stipulates that only the "true heir" may claim it.

To determine worthiness, the heirs must remain in the house until dawn and complete a series of trials she designed before her death. The doors seal. There is no leaving.

## The Lie (What Players Believe)
The players believe they are competing (perhaps reluctantly cooperating) to prove themselves the true heir to Yackle's legacy. They think the goal is survival and worthiness.

## The Truth (What's Really Happening)
One player IS Yackle, polymorphed and playing a long game. She has lured these specific people here because each of them, unknowingly, possesses something she needs — a memory, a bloodline, a magical resonance, a secret. The "trials" are designed to extract these things, killing or weakening the hosts in the process.

The inheritance is bait. The house is a trap. The witch is among them.

## The Actual Goal
Survive. Defeat Yackle in a multi-stage final battle. Get as many players out alive as possible.

---

# THE SECRET WITCH PLAYER

## Before the Session
Pull one player aside (or message them privately if online) before the game begins. This player will play Yackle in disguise.

## What the Witch Player Receives

### Their True Character Sheet
Yackle, ancient witch, with a separate stat block and abilities that "unlock" at the reveal. Until then, they play their cover identity fully — a believable person with a backstory, fears, and apparent motivations for wanting the inheritance.

### Their Secret Goal
Survive to the reveal in Stage III/IV. Manipulate events subtly. Extract what you need from the other players during the trials. 

**Critical instruction:** You're not trying to "win" D&D — you're trying to create a great story. Play your cover identity genuinely. Bond with people. Make them trust you. The betrayal should *hurt*.

### Their Constraints
- Cannot directly attack other players until the reveal
- Can sabotage subtly (misdirection, "accidentally" triggering traps, withholding information)
- Must participate in trials authentically (Yackle needs them to succeed for her plan)
- Has three "Witch's Whisper" tokens: spend one to secretly communicate with the DM and influence something in the house (a door locks, a clue disappears, something moves in the shadows)

### The Reveal Mechanic
The witch player knows the reveal is coming but doesn't control exactly when. Tell them: "In the final stage, something will happen that forces your transformation. You'll feel it coming — play into it. Make it dramatic."

# TONE AND THEMES

## Primary Tones
- **Intrigue** — Who are these people? Why were they chosen? What are they hiding?
- **Awe and Wonder** — The house contains marvels: impossible rooms, beautiful magic, remnants of a life lived in power
- **Gothic Horror** — Slow-building dread, the house as character, claustrophobia, paranoia
- **Emotional Weight** — Bonds form under pressure; the betrayal should land

## What to Avoid
- Pure slasher/splatter horror
- Anything too similar to "A Night at the Opera" / Observer Effect (Delta Green) — the players just played this, so avoid surveillance horror, modern settings, or "the monster is watching you through cameras" vibes
- Obvious villain telegraphing — the witch player should seem as legitimate as anyone else

## Haunting of Hill House Influence
- The house has personality and history
- Rooms reflect psychological states
- The past intrudes on the present
- Family/found family dynamics under strain
- The horror is emotional as much as physical
- Beauty and terror coexist

---

# MAGUIRE LORE TO USE

## Deep Cuts (Not Obvious Stuff)

### Yackle Herself
Not just "a witch" — she's something stranger. She appears at Elphaba's birth, seems to exist outside normal time, and may have been *created* by the Grimmerie rather than born. She calls herself a "maunt" but also claims to have been a fish, a dancer, and things without names. She cannot die easily — she's tried. She may be the Grimmerie's agent or a manifestation of Ozian magic seeking balance.

**For the game:** A villain who isn't purely evil but is *compelled*, ancient, tired, and perhaps seeking an end she can only achieve through consumption of others.

### The Clock of the Time Dragon
A mechanical puppet theatre that travels Oz and reveals hidden truths — adultery, crimes, futures, secrets. Operated by a dwarf called Mr. Boss. The Clock knows things it shouldn't and doesn't lie, but shows truth cruelly.

**For the game:** Potential set piece for the reveal, or foreshadowing device.

### The Unnamed God and Unionism
The god must never be named — to name it is to limit it. Factions include mercy-focused and wrath-focused branches. Monastic orders (maunts), self-flagellants, ecstatics. The pleasure faith (older Lurlinism) celebrated the body; Unionism often mortifies it.

**For the game:** Religious texture, guilt as theme, what is sacred?

### The Kumbric Witch
Before Lurline, before the Unnamed God. Possibly the first witch, possibly older than Oz. Associated with the Grimmerie's creation. Yackle may be her daughter, echo, or failed replacement.

**For the game:** Mythic depth. Yackle is part of something *old*.

### The Sleeve of Ghosts
A valley in the Kells where the dead walk and time moves wrong. Travelers enter and exit years apart. Some believe it's where the Time Dragon sleeps.

**For the game:** Possible origin for the house, or why it exists outside normal rules.

### Southstairs
The Wizard's secret prison beneath the Emerald City. Symbol of oubliettes, places where inconvenient people stop existing.

**For the game:** Architectural motif. The house as a kind of Southstairs for the dead.

### The Quadling Genocide
The Wizard systematically drained the Quadling marshes, destroying their way of life. The rubies may be Quadling blood crystallized.

**For the game:** The inheritance might be built on atrocity. A player could be Quadling with connection to this history.

### Nor's Imprisonment / The Scraping
Elphaba's granddaughter was held in prison camps, experimented on, tortured through magical interrogation called "the Scraping." She survived but was broken.

**For the game:** Oz has living memory of state violence. A player could be a Scraping survivor.

# STAGE OPTIONS (Choose One Per Stage)

## STAGE I: ARRIVAL

### Option A: "The Reading"
**Vibe:** Classic gothic, Knives Out energy

Players arrive separately, meet in the foyer. Mr. Trism (nervous, possibly Tiktok) reads the will, which describes each heir not by name but by cryptic epithet ("the one who burned the letter," "the one who dreams of green"). The house is grand but wrong — proportions off, shadows that don't match. The will states they must remain until dawn; doors seal. 

**Key Moment:** The will names a *seventh heir* who isn't present. An empty chair at the table.

---

### Option B: "The Body"
**Vibe:** Murder mystery, immediate threat

Players arrive to find Mr. Trism dead on the threshold, the will clutched in his hand. They're trapped before they can process. The house is already hostile — something killed Trism, and it's still here.

**Key Moment:** Trism's body is wearing Yackle's face — a porcelain mask strapped over his features.

---

### Option C: "The Clock"
**Vibe:** Surreal, prophetic dread

Players arrive and find a miniature Clock of the Time Dragon in the foyer, already performing. It shows each of them in turn — scenes from their past they've never told anyone. Private shames, secret hopes. Then it shows them all dead, in this house, tonight. It shows one of them standing over the bodies. Then it stops. Mr. Trism (deeply unsettled) insists this is "part of the test."

**Key Moment:** The player shown as the killer is *not* the witch player. The Clock is lying — or showing a possible future — or the witch player manipulated it.

---

## STAGE II: EXPLORATION

### Option A: "The Rooms Reveal"
**Vibe:** Haunting of Hill House, personal horror

The house has a room for each player — spaces designed around their specific fears, memories, or desires. Players explore freely but are drawn to their room. Each room contains a gift (something wondrous and useful) and a price (a secret revealed to whoever witnesses it).

**Key Moments:**
- A nursery with toys that remember the player's childhood
- A surgery theatre with instruments sized for Animals
- A ballroom where ghosts dance and invite players to join
- A greenhouse of plants from the Quadling marshes, tended by something unseen

**Bonding Beat:** A kitchen that only serves food when multiple players are present.

---

### Option B: "The Doors Unlock"
**Vibe:** Puzzle-box, cooperative discovery

The house has seven wings, each sealed. Players must work together to unlock them — each door requires something only one player can provide (a memory spoken aloud, blood, a song, a confession). Each wing contains lore, treasure, and warnings about what Yackle is.

**Key Moments:**
- A library where books must be read aloud to reveal their contents — and some contain spells that activate when spoken
- A gallery of portraits that age or youth as you watch
- A menagerie of preserved Animals (taxidermy? or something worse?)
- A chapel to the Unnamed God with an altar that demands offerings

**Bonding Beat:** One door requires two players to sacrifice a shared memory — they must agree on something they both experienced.

---

### Option C: "The Night Walks"
**Vibe:** Freeform exploration, mounting wrongness

The house appears normal at first — grand, dusty, abandoned. Players explore freely, piecing together who Yackle was. But as time passes, the house changes. Rooms connect differently. Distances stretch. The dead appear — not hostile, just *present*, going about routines from their lives. The house is a kind of afterlife, and the players are intruding.

**Key Moments:**
- A ghost child playing with toys asks if the players want to stay forever
- A spectral dinner party continues in the dining room; players can join and eavesdrop
- The walls begin showing scenes like the Clock — histories of this house, what happened to previous heirs
- Somewhere, a woman is singing a Quadling lullaby

**Bonding Beat:** At midnight, all ghosts vanish and the house goes cold and silent. The players are completely alone together for the first time.

---

## STAGE III: TRIALS

### Option A: "The Tests of the Will"
**Vibe:** Formal, ritualized, high-stakes choices

Yackle's will contained seven tests (one for each heir, including the missing seventh). Each test takes place in a specific chamber and requires the heir to demonstrate a virtue: courage, honesty, sacrifice, wisdom, compassion, memory, and *hunger*. The tests are magical and cannot be cheated. Other players can witness but not help.

**Key Moments:**
- The Test of Sacrifice asks what you'd give up to save a stranger — and manifests someone to save
- The Test of Honesty forces you to speak a truth you've never told anyone
- The Test of Hunger asks what you want badly enough to kill for — and shows you could have it

**Approaching the Reveal:** The seventh test (for the absent heir) activates automatically. The witch player feels it pulling at them. They must either complete it (revealing themselves) or resist (which costs them and delays the reveal).

---

### Option B: "The Extraction"
**Vibe:** Body horror, magical surgery, intimacy

The players discover Yackle's true purpose: she designed the house to *extract* things from her heirs. Not just secrets — something physical. A memory made tangible. A year of life crystallized. A feeling bottled. The house has been doing this all along, slowly. Now it accelerates. Each player must choose what to give up, or have it taken by force.

**Key Moments:**
- A player coughs up a glass bead containing their happiest memory — they can no longer recall it clearly
- A player's shadow detaches and becomes a separate entity they must negotiate with
- A mirror shows a player twenty years older; looking away, they find a gray hair that wasn't there before

**Approaching the Reveal:** The witch player is *immune* to the extraction. Observant players may notice they never lose anything. When confronted (or when the extractions complete), the reveal triggers.

---

### Option C: "The Culling"
**Vibe:** Slasher logic, survival, paranoia

The trials aren't formal — they're just survival. The house begins trying to kill the players. Traps activate. Rooms become hostile. Something *hunts* them through the halls. Players must work together to survive while also watching each other — because it becomes clear the house is responding to *someone's* will.

**Key Moments:**
- A player separated from the group faces a creature that knows their name
- The hunters seem to avoid one player (the witch) — or target them specifically as misdirection
- A safe room exists, but it only fits four; six are trying to reach it
- A dying moment: someone (NPC or player) gives last words, a clue, a warning

**Approaching the Reveal:** The players corner the "source" of the hunting — and discover it's been controlled from within the group all along.

---

## STAGE IV: RECKONING

### Option A: "The Throne"
**Vibe:** Confrontation, boss battle, classic climax

The reveal happens in a throne room at the house's heart. Yackle drops pretense and monologues briefly — why these players, what she needed, what she's become. Then she takes her true form and fights. 

**The battle is multi-stage:**
1. Yackle alone (full power, legendary actions)
2. Yackle merged with the house (environment attacks, skill challenges to reach her)
3. Race to destroy her heart/anchor while she throws everything at them

**Final Choice:** The house can be destroyed or claimed. Destroying it ends Yackle forever but erases everything she knew (including genuinely valuable knowledge). Claiming it means someone must *stay* as its new master.

---

### Option B: "The Dawn Race"
**Vibe:** Survival, ticking clock, frantic escape

The reveal triggers a countdown: dawn is coming, and Yackle must complete her ritual before sunrise or lose everything. The players don't need to kill her — they need to *survive until dawn*. The house is her weapon; they must evade, barricade, and sabotage. Combat happens in bursts. The tension is environmental and temporal.

**Final Choice:** At the last moment, players can escape alone (some survive, some don't) or make a stand together (all or nothing). The witch player, even revealed, might be offered mercy — she's ancient and tired; maybe she just wants it to end.

---

### Option C: "The Unmaking"
**Vibe:** Ritual, sacrifice, bittersweet

The reveal doesn't lead to combat — it leads to a horrible understanding. Yackle can't be killed normally. She's bound to the house, to the Grimmerie's magic, to something deeper. The players must perform a counter-ritual to unmake her, and it requires components only they can provide: the things the house extracted from them, freely given back. The "battle" is a series of skill challenges and sacrifices.

**Final Choice:** The unmaking requires someone to take Yackle's place — to become the house's new anchor, the new Yackle. Someone must volunteer, or the ritual fails and everyone dies. The volunteer doesn't die; they become something else.

---

# SUGGESTED COMBINATIONS

## "The Gothic Classic"
**Reading → Rooms Reveal → Tests of the Will → Throne**

Formal, structured, satisfying arc. Best for groups who like clear progression and traditional climaxes.

## "The Paranoia Engine"
**Body → Night Walks → Culling → Dawn Race**

Tense, chaotic, survival-focused. Best for groups who like improvisation and pressure.

## "The Tragic Opera"
**Clock → Doors Unlock → Extraction → Unmaking**

Surreal, emotional, bittersweet ending. Best for groups who want meaningful choices and melancholy.

---

# THE MULTI-STAGE FINAL BATTLE (Detailed)

Regardless of which Stage IV option is chosen, the final confrontation should have multiple phases:

## Phase 1: The Witch Ascendant
Yackle in full power, the house fighting alongside her.
- Legendary actions (3/round)
- Lair actions (initiative 20)
- Players are on the defensive, trying to survive and find weaknesses
- **Goal:** Drive her from this form — when bloodied (half HP), she transforms

## Phase 2: The House Unleashed
Yackle merges with the house itself.
- Players must reach her heart (a physical location) while the environment attacks
- Animated furniture, collapsing floors, rooms that try to digest them
- Skill challenges mixed with combat encounters
- **Goal:** Reach the heart chamber

## Phase 3: The Unmaking
Yackle's original body, connected to the house by magical roots/veins/threads.
- She's vulnerable here but desperate
- Players who fell in earlier stages might appear as ghostly aid (or final obstacles if turned)
- **The killing blow requires a sacrifice or a choice** — pure damage won't end her

## Possible Final Choices
- Destroy the grimoire (ending Yackle but losing all magical knowledge)
- Trap her in the house forever (someone must stay to maintain the binding)
- Offer mercy (radically different ending if players try to *save* Yackle from what she's become)

---

# KEY NPCs

## Mr. Trism
The solicitor. Nervous, thin, possibly a Tiktok (mechanical being). He serves the will's requirements but may not understand what Yackle truly intended. Depending on the opening chosen, he may be:
- Alive and trapped with the players (nervous ally)
- Dead on arrival (mystery catalyst)
- Something else entirely (puppet? ghost? Yackle's creation?)

## Yackle (Witch Player's True Form)
Ancient. Tired. Powerful. She's lived too long and tried to die. She may be a fragment of the Kumbric Witch, created by the Grimmerie, or something stranger. Her motivation isn't pure evil — she needs something these heirs have, and consuming them is the only way she knows to get it.

**Stat Block:** Build as a CR 10-12 encounter for the final battle, with phases that escalate difficulty.

## The House Itself
Not an NPC exactly, but treat it as a character:
- It has moods
- It has favorites (and least favorites)
- It remembers everyone who's ever died here
- It may be Yackle's prison as much as her weapon

## Ghosts/Echoes (If Used)
Previous heirs who came before. They're not fully conscious — more like recordings. But some have fragments of awareness. They can provide clues, warnings, or misdirection.

---

# PLAYER CHARACTERS

## Pre-Generated vs. Created
For a one-shot with mixed experience, **pre-generated characters are recommended** with:
- Clear motivations for wanting the inheritance
- Secret connections to Oz lore
- Hidden flaws or shames the house can exploit
- One is secretly Yackle

## Suggested Character Concepts

### The Scholar
Came seeking Yackle's library — forbidden knowledge about the Grimmerie. May have Grimmerie corruption already.

### The Heir by Blood
Actually related to Yackle (or believes they are). Has a family claim but also family shame.

### The Animal in Hiding
An Animal (capital A, sentient) passing as human or hiding their status. Came because Yackle reportedly sheltered Animals. Has connections to the resistance.

### The Debt-Holder
Owes someone powerful. The inheritance could clear the debt. Desperate, maybe willing to do things the others wouldn't.

### The Maunt/Former Unionist
Left the church under mysterious circumstances. May have had visions of Yackle. Seeking answers about faith, magic, or their own past.

### The Widow/Orphan
Lost someone to the Wizard's regime, the war, or Yackle herself. Came seeking answers, closure, or revenge.

### Yackle's Vessel (The Secret Witch)
Cover identity can be any of the above. The player should choose what feels most natural to roleplay. Their "true" backstory is a fabrication Yackle created.

---

# FORESHADOWING THE TWIST

Throughout Stages I-III, plant clues that something is wrong with one of the heirs:

## Subtle Clues
- The witch player never seems cold (Yackle runs hot)
- The house *recognizes* them in small ways (doors open easily, servants defer)
- Their reflection is occasionally wrong (older, greener, different)
- They know things they shouldn't (and must excuse it away)
- Animals are uneasy around them (if any Animal NPCs or players)

## Moderate Clues
- They're immune to certain house effects (the extraction, specific traps)
- The ghosts avoid them or react strangely
- The Clock (if present) shows them differently than the others
- Their "memories" from backstory don't quite add up

## Obvious Clues (Right Before Reveal)
- They speak words they don't remember saying
- Their hands look different for a moment
- Something in the house explicitly names them as Yackle
- They feel power surging through them and must fight to contain it

---

# MECHANICS TO PREPARE

## The Witch's Whisper Tokens
Three tokens for the witch player to spend (secretly, via note or text to DM):
- Influence something in the house
- Add a detail that wasn't there before
- Make a clue disappear
- Cause a distraction

## Extraction Effects (If Using That Option)
Create a table of things that can be extracted:
- Happiest memory
- A year of life (physically age)
- A relationship (forget someone)
- A skill (lose proficiency temporarily)
- A secret (revealed to all)
- A sense (blinded, deafened temporarily)

## Trials (If Using That Option)
Design specific trials for each virtue:
- **Courage:** Face a manifestation of your fear
- **Honesty:** Speak a truth under Zone of Truth
- **Sacrifice:** Give up something real (item, ability, memory)
- **Wisdom:** Solve a puzzle with incomplete information
- **Compassion:** Help an NPC ghost/victim at cost to yourself
- **Memory:** Recall details from earlier in the session (tests player attention)
- **Hunger:** State what you want badly enough to kill for — then see it offered

## The Final Battle
- Yackle stat block (multiple phases)
- Lair actions
- Environmental hazards
- Win conditions (damage vs. ritual vs. survival)

---

# HANDOUTS AND PROPS

## The Will
Write out Yackle's will with cryptic descriptions of each heir. Give this as a physical handout.

## The Letters
Each player can receive their invitation letter before the session (builds anticipation).

## The Map
A floor plan of the manor that changes or has hidden rooms revealed throughout play.

## Character Secrets
Index cards with each player's hidden shame/secret that the house will exploit.

## The Witch's Briefing
A separate document for the witch player explaining their true nature and goals.

---

# SESSION ZERO CONSIDERATIONS

## Tone Agreement
Establish that this is:
- Gothic horror (atmospheric, not gore)
- Includes a hidden traitor mechanic
- Will have moments of wonder alongside horror
- PvP is possible at the end but the goal is collaborative storytelling

## Lines and Veils
Check for sensitivities around:
- Body horror
- Memory loss/alteration
- Betrayal by trusted figures
- Death (of PCs)
- Religious themes

## Player Buy-In
The witch player must want to play this role. Don't assign it randomly — pick someone who will enjoy the challenge of acting, lying, and ultimately making the betrayal land emotionally.

---

# WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED

1. **Final stage selection** — Pick one option for each of the four stages
2. **Pre-generated characters** — Full character sheets with secrets and connections
3. **Yackle's stat block** — Three-phase boss fight
4. **Specific rooms/encounters** — Based on which Stage II option is chosen
5. **Trials design** — If using "Tests of the Will"
6. **Handout props** — Will, letters, map
7. **Music/ambiance playlist** — Gothic, mysterious, Oz-appropriate
8. **Session zero plan** — How to onboard the witch player secretly

---

# SUMMARY FOR COLLABORATION

This one-shot is:
- **Setting:** Maguire's Oz (Wicked universe)
- **Premise:** Heirs summoned to claim a witch's inheritance
- **Twist:** One player is secretly the witch, manipulating everyone
- **Tone:** Gothic mystery, intrigue, wonder, horror
- **Structure:** Four stages (Arrival → Exploration → Trials → Reckoning)
- **Climax:** Multi-stage boss battle against the revealed witch
- **Themes:** Trust, identity, what we inherit, what we owe the past

The document above contains all the options discussed. The next step is to select specific options for each stage and begin developing the detailed encounters, characters, and mechanics.
