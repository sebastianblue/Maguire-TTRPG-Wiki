<h1>Pre-Generated Character: The Heir by Blood</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"I didn't ask for this legacy, but I won't run from it either."</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This character has the strongest legal claim to Yackle's estate through direct descent from the Thropp family line. Their presence threatens Yackle's plans and makes them a priority target. They may recognize certain family heirlooms or architectural features that others miss.</p>

<h2>Background Feature: Family Recognition</h2>
<p>You bear an unmistakable resemblance to the Thropp line—the same sharp features, the same intense eyes. In Munchkinland and among those who remember the old families, you can gain audience with nobility, access family records, and receive reluctant respect even from those who despise your infamous relatives. However, the Thropp name also brings suspicion, fear, and outright hostility in many quarters.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>I stand up straight and speak clearly—I won't be ashamed of my blood</li>
<li>I notice when people are lying or hiding something; my family taught me to watch for knives in the dark</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ideal</h3>
<p><strong>Responsibility.</strong> I didn't choose my ancestors, but I can choose what I do with their legacy. (Lawful)</p>

<h3>Bond</h3>
<p>My family's honor has been dragged through the mud by Elphaba's infamy and the Wizard's propaganda. I will reclaim what dignity I can.</p>

<h3>Flaw</h3>
<p>I'm quick to anger when someone insults my family, even when staying calm would be smarter.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>Liir Opp is a third cousin to Elphaba Thropp, descended from a younger branch of the family from Munchkinland. He grew up hearing whispered stories about his infamous relative—some called her a terrorist, others a freedom fighter, and a few whispered "witch" with genuine fear.</p>

<p>When his family fell on hard times, Liir joined the local militia to earn steady pay. He proved himself a capable soldier and rose to sergeant, but he never quite escaped the shadow of his name. Some commanders trusted him; others watched him for signs of disloyalty.</p>

<p>The letter arrived three weeks ago: an inheritance from a distant relative he'd never heard of. Yackle. The solicitor's letter mentioned "blood of the Thropp line" and "rightful heir." The amount wasn't specified, but the estate was supposedly substantial.</p>

<p>Liir requested leave and traveled to the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/pertha-hills', 'Pertha Hills'); return false;">Pertha Hills</a>. He doesn't trust this—nothing involving his family is ever straightforward—but he's curious, and frankly, he could use the money. He's also aware that if there really is a Thropp estate, he might be the only heir with the legal standing and the steel spine to actually claim it.</p>

<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>

<p>Liir has never heard of Yackle before receiving the inheritance letter, but she clearly knows of him. As the only heir with documented Thropp lineage, he represents the strongest legal claim to the estate—which makes him either the rightful inheritor or the most dangerous obstacle to Yackle's plans.</p>

<p><strong>What Liir Doesn't Know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yackle is an immortal witch who has manipulated the Thropp family for generations</li>
<li>His "rightful claim" is exactly why she invited him—as a potential vessel or sacrifice</li>
<li>Some of the items in the manor bear the Thropp family crest because Yackle has been collecting them for centuries</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Liir Might Notice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Family heirlooms he's only seen in paintings at his grandmother's house</li>
<li>Architectural features similar to Colwen Grounds (the Thropp family estate)</li>
<li>A portrait in the gallery that looks disturbingly like his own grandfather</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Liir</h2>

<h3>Mannerisms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stands at parade rest when waiting (military habit)</li>
<li>Touches his family signet ring when nervous or thinking</li>
<li>Addresses nobles and authority figures properly, even when he doesn't respect them</li>
<li>Quick to place himself between threats and civilians (protective instinct)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voice and Speech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speaks in clear, measured tones—trained to give orders</li>
<li>Uses military terminology ("secure the perimeter," "tactical withdrawal")</li>
<li>Brief and direct in conversation; wastes few words</li>
<li>Voice hardens when discussing his family's reputation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Understand what he's inherited and whether the claim is legitimate</li>
<li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Protect the other heirs if things go wrong (soldier's instinct)</li>
<li><strong>Hidden:</strong> Find something—anything—that redeems the Thropp name, or at least proves they weren't all monsters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Tips</h2>

<h3>Playing Liir Effectively</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be the Protector:</strong> You're the tank. Position yourself between enemies and squishier party members. Use Rally to keep allies in the fight.</li>
<li><strong>Military Mindset:</strong> Approach problems tactically. Suggest defensive positions, watch patterns, identify threats.</li>
<li><strong>Family Burden:</strong> The Thropp name is both your claim to this inheritance and a weight you carry. React when you see family crests, heirlooms, or references to Elphaba.</li>
<li><strong>Controlled Emotion:</strong> You're disciplined, but not unfeeling. When someone insults your family, you tense up. When you find proof they weren't all evil, you show quiet relief.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Role:</strong> You're used to giving orders and coordinating squad tactics. Naturally step into a leadership role in combat, but defer to others' expertise outside battle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recognize a Thropp family heirloom: "That tapestry—I've seen the twin of it at Colwen Grounds. How did it get here?"</li>
<li>React to Yackle's manipulation: "You claim to know my family. Prove it."</li>
<li>Protect another heir: "Get behind me. Whatever that thing is, it goes through me first."</li>
<li>Discover family connection to Yackle: "My grandmother never mentioned anyone named Yackle. Who were you to the Thropps, really?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>

<h3>First Round</h3>
<ul>
<li>Position yourself to protect squishier allies (Scholar, anyone in robes)</li>
<li>If enemies are grouped, consider using handaxe at range before closing</li>
<li>Save Action Surge for when you really need to end a threat quickly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Riposte:</strong> Your reaction maneuver—use it against enemies who miss you</li>
<li><strong>Precision Attack:</strong> Use when you need a hit to land (especially against priority targets)</li>
<li><strong>Disarming Attack:</strong> Use against enemies wielding dangerous weapons or spellcasting focuses</li>
<li><strong>Rally:</strong> Use as bonus action to give temp HP to badly wounded allies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Defensive Play</h3>
<ul>
<li>AC 18 + shield means you're hard to hit—use that to draw enemy attacks</li>
<li>Second Wind when you drop to half HP or below</li>
<li>If facing multiple enemies, consider taking Dodge action after using Second Wind to recover safely</li>
</ul>

<h3>Against Yackle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Close distance quickly—she's a spellcaster who wants range. Use Precision Attack to ensure hits against her high AC.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> When she merges with the house, protect squishier allies from lair actions and house attacks. Use Rally to keep people conscious.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Focus fire on her vulnerable essence. Use Action Surge to deliver maximum damage before she can escape or cast her final curse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Character Development</h2>

<h3>If Liir Survives</h3>
<ul>
<li>He might actually inherit the estate—what would he do with a manor steeped in dark magic?</li>
<li>He could discover that not all Thropps were villains, and perhaps neither was Elphaba</li>
<li>The experience might lead him to investigate his family's true history, uncovering secrets the Wizard's regime has suppressed</li>
<li>He might choose to tear down the manor and build something new—literally and figuratively breaking with the past</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Character Arc</h3>
<p>Liir begins the adventure believing the Thropp legacy is a burden to be endured. By the end, he might realize it's a responsibility to be wielded—that he can choose what the Thropp name means going forward. Or he might reject the inheritance entirely, deciding some legacies are better left buried.</p>

<h2>GM Notes</h2>

<h3>Using Liir in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family Recognition:</strong> Liir can recognize Thropp family items throughout the manor. Use this to feed him information and clues others might miss.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Claim:</strong> Liir has the strongest legal right to the inheritance. Yackle may try to manipulate this, offering him the estate in exchange for cooperation—or targeting him first because he's the biggest threat to her plans.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Anchor:</strong> As the party tank, Liir will likely lead the charge in combat encounters. Make sure to target him with some attacks so his high AC feels meaningful, but also threaten squishier allies so his protective instincts matter.</li>
<li><strong>Moral Compass:</strong> Liir's lawful neutral alignment means he values duty and order, but he's not naive. He can be the voice of caution or pragmatism when the party considers risky plans.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plot Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>A portrait in the gallery shows a Thropp ancestor wearing the same signet ring Liir now wears</li>
<li>Yackle has been manipulating the Thropp line for generations—Liir's very existence might be part of her centuries-long plan</li>
<li>The manor's library contains a genealogy showing Yackle's name intertwined with the Thropp family tree in impossible ways</li>
<li>One of Yackle's spell components is a lock of hair from a Thropp—possibly Liir's distant ancestor, possibly his grandmother</li>
</ul>
