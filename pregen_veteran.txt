<h1>Pre-Generated Character: The Veteran</h1>

<p class="flavor-text">"I've seen enough horrors on the battlefield. Let's get this inheritance business done so I can retire somewhere quiet."</p>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>GM Note:</strong> This character is a retired <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('factions/gale-force', 'Gale Force'); return false;">Gale Force</a> soldier carrying the weight of war crimes and moral compromises. She participated in the Animal purges, the Quadling campaigns, and other atrocities. Now she's trying to leave that life behind, but her skills (and sins) follow her. Yackle may have served with her under a false identity, or may use her guilt as leverage.</p>

<li>Steel shield with faded Gale Force insignia (she's tried to scrub it off)</li>
<li>Longsword (military issue, well-maintained)</li>
<li>Lance (rarely used anymore, but she kept it)</li>
<li>Three javelins</li>
<li>Heavy crossbow with 20 bolts</li>
<li>Dungeoneer's pack</li>

<li>Hip flask (usually empty, sometimes not)</li>

<h2>Background Feature: Military Rank</h2>

<p>You still carry the bearing of a Gale Force officer. Soldiers and guards recognize your authority (or used to). You can requisition basic supplies from military outposts, gain access to restricted areas by citing old regulations, and invoke military hierarchy when dealing with active-duty personnel. However, this also means you're recognized—and not everyone remembers Gale Force fondly.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<h3>Personality Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wake up at dawn out of habit, even when I don't want to</li>
<li>I speak in short, clipped sentences and dislike flowery language or long explanations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ideal</h3>
<p><strong>Redemption.</strong> I can't undo what I've done, but I can choose to do better from here on. (Good)</p>

<h3>Bond</h3>
<p>I failed the people I was ordered to harm. I carry their faces with me every day.</p>

<h3>Flaw</h3>
<p>I follow orders reflexively, even when I shouldn't—twenty years of military conditioning doesn't just disappear.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>Mareth Trynn joined <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('factions/gale-force', 'Gale Force'); return false;">Gale Force</a> at seventeen, drawn by promises of adventure, purpose, and steady pay. She rose through the ranks quickly—she was strong, disciplined, and didn't ask inconvenient questions. By twenty-five, she was a captain leading a mounted cavalry unit.</p>

<p>She served in the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('events/quadling-campaigns', 'Quadling campaigns'); return false;">Quadling campaigns</a>. She participated in the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('events/animal-purges', 'Animal purges'); return false;">Animal purges</a>. She followed orders—terrible, brutal orders—because that's what soldiers do. She told herself it was necessary. She told herself she was protecting Oz. She told herself a lot of things.</p>

<p>The breaking point came during a raid on a suspected <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('character/races/animals/overview', 'Animal'); return false;">Animal</a> hideout. Her unit found families hiding in a cellar—foxes, badgers, a family of mice. The order came down: no survivors. Mareth stood in that cellar, sword in hand, looking at children.</p>

<p>She didn't give the order to kill. But she didn't stop it either. She stood there and let it happen.</p>

<p>A week later, she requested discharge. She cited injury (not entirely false—her knee aches when it rains, courtesy of a Quadling spear). It was granted. She left the military with an honorable discharge, commendations for bravery, and nightmares that wake her up screaming.</p>

<p>She's been drifting for two years, taking odd jobs as a guard or escort, trying to figure out how to live with herself. The inheritance letter from Yackle arrived at a tavern where she was drinking away her pension. A distant relative, apparently. Money she didn't earn by following monstrous orders.</p>

<p>She came to the <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('exploration/regions/pertha-hills', 'Pertha Hills'); return false;">Pertha Hills</a> because she had nowhere else to go. And because part of her hoped the estate would have something—anything—that could make sense of the last twenty years.</p>

<h2>Connection to Yackle</h2>

<p>Mareth has no memory of anyone named Yackle in her family, and military records don't show any relative by that name. This should be suspicious, but Mareth is too worn down to care much.</p>

<p><strong>What Mareth Doesn't Know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yackle may have served in Gale Force under a false identity—perhaps the medic who treated Mareth's knee, or the quartermaster who approved her discharge</li>
<li>Yackle has been collecting soldiers haunted by guilt—they make interesting subjects for magical experiments involving conscience, memory, and pain</li>
<li>The inheritance might be payment for atrocities Mareth committed—or a test to see if she can be redeemed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Mareth Might Discover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Military documents in the manor showing Yackle's involvement in Gale Force logistics or strategy</li>
<li>Evidence that Yackle engineered some of the orders Mareth followed (was she being manipulated all along?)</li>
<li>A room containing items taken from the Animals killed in the purges—trophies, or something darker</li>
<li>The ghosts of those Mareth failed to protect, given form by the manor's magic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Mareth</h2>

<h3>Mannerisms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stands at attention when thinking, then forces herself to relax</li>
<li>Unconsciously scans rooms for exits, threats, tactical positions</li>
<li>Rubs her left knee when it aches (injury from the war, aches in cold/damp)</li>
<li>Salutes superiors reflexively, then catches herself (she's retired, she doesn't have to do that anymore)</li>
<li>Polishes her sword when anxious—the repetitive motion is calming</li>
</ul>

<h3>Voice and Speech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speaks in military shorthand: "Affirmative," "Negative," "Secure the perimeter"</li>
<li>Blunt and direct; no patience for manipulation or lies</li>
<li>Gruff exterior, but softens when talking about horses or nature</li>
<li>Avoids talking about the war unless directly asked, then becomes clipped and distant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Claim the inheritance and finally have enough money to retire somewhere peaceful</li>
<li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Protect the other heirs—she's failed to protect people before, she won't fail again</li>
<li><strong>Hidden:</strong> Find some way to atone for what she's done, or at least forgive herself</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roleplaying Tips</h2>

<h3>Playing Mareth Effectively</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Tank:</strong> You have the highest HP and AC in the party. Stand between danger and your allies. Use Second Wind to stay in the fight. This is your role, and you're good at it.</li>
<li><strong>Guilt and Duty:</strong> You're trying to be better than you were. When civilian lives are at stake, you intervene—even recklessly. You won't fail to protect people again.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Mind:</strong> You think in terms of formations, sight lines, choke points. Suggest defensive positions, identify ambush points, plan retreats. This is instinct.</li>
<li><strong>Moral Complexity:</strong> You did terrible things under orders. You're not a villain, but you're not a hero either. Explore that gray space.</li>
<li><strong>Blunt Honesty:</strong> You don't lie well and don't see the point. If someone asks if you've killed people, you say yes. If they ask if you regret it, you say yes to that too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>React to military equipment: "This sword—Gale Force issue, cavalry pattern. How did Yackle get this?"</li>
<li>Protect an Animal character: "I've failed your people before. I won't do it again. You're under my protection."</li>
<li>Confront Yackle about the purges: "If you had anything to do with those orders, I'll end you myself."</li>
<li>Struggle with authority: Someone gives you an order, you start to follow it reflexively, then stop yourself: "I'm not in the military anymore. I don't have to—I choose not to."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>

<h3>First Round</h3>
<ul>
<li>Close distance to frontline position</li>
<li>Engage the most dangerous enemy to draw attacks away from squishier allies</li>
<li>Save Action Surge for when you really need to drop an enemy fast</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ongoing Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Critical:</strong> You crit on 19-20, so swing often—the more attacks, the more crits</li>
<li><strong>High HP Tank:</strong> With 48 HP, you can absorb a lot of damage. Don't waste Second Wind early—use it when you drop to ~15-20 HP</li>
<li><strong>Longsword Versatility:</strong> Use one-handed with shield (AC 18) in most fights. Switch to two-handed (1d10+3 damage) if you need more offense and can sacrifice AC</li>
<li><strong>Protect Allies:</strong> Position yourself between enemies and your spellcasters. Use your high AC to soak hits they can't afford to take</li>
</ul>

<h3>Defensive Play</h3>
<ul>
<li>AC 18 + 48 HP makes you very durable</li>
<li>Second Wind as bonus action when needed (1d10+5 healing, usually 10-15 HP)</li>
<li>Don't be reckless—you're tough, not invincible</li>
<li>If surrounded, consider using Action Surge to Disengage and reposition rather than attacking</li>
</ul>

<h3>Against Yackle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Close the gap and lock her down in melee. Your high AC helps against her spell attacks. Use Action Surge to deliver two full attacks in one round.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> When she merges with the house, protect allies from lair actions and house horrors. Be the shield that keeps the party alive.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Burn Action Surge and Second Wind if needed. You're here to protect people—finish the job.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Consideration: The Animal in Hiding</h2>

<div class="gm-warning">
<p><strong>Potential Party Tension:</strong> If <a href="#" onclick="Tabs.openTab('adventures/the-witchs-wake/pregens/the-animal', 'The Animal in Hiding'); return false;">Frederick/Quick-Paw</a> is in the party and his true nature is revealed, this creates dramatic tension.</p>

<p>Mareth participated in Animal purges. She has Animal blood on her hands. When Frederick is revealed as a Fox Animal, how does she react?</p>

<p><strong>Possible Responses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protector:</strong> "I won't let anyone hurt you. I've failed your kind before. Not again."</li>
<li><strong>Guilt:</strong> She can't even look at him. The shame is overwhelming.</li>
<li><strong>Apology:</strong> "I can't undo what I did. But I can stand between you and anyone who'd try it now."</li>
<li><strong>Awkward Alliance:</strong> They work together because they have to, but the tension is palpable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let the players navigate this. It's rich roleplay material.</p>
</div>

<h2>Character Development</h2>

<h3>If Mareth Survives</h3>
<ul>
<li>She might use the inheritance to fund reparations for Animal communities harmed by Gale Force</li>
<li>She could become a protector of refugees and escaped Animals, finally using her military skills for something good</li>
<li>She might track down her former commanding officers and hold them accountable for their orders</li>
<li>Or she might finally forgive herself, realizing that spending the rest of her life punishing herself doesn't help the people she harmed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Potential Character Arc</h3>
<p>Mareth begins the adventure carrying crushing guilt, believing she's beyond redemption. By the end, she might learn that atonement isn't about erasing the past—it's about choosing to do better in every moment going forward. Or she might conclude that some sins can't be forgiven, only endured. Either way, she'll keep protecting people. It's all she knows how to do.</p>

<h2>GM Notes</h2>

<h3>Using Mareth in the Adventure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moral Weight:</strong> Mareth represents the consequences of following unjust orders. Use her to explore themes of complicity, guilt, and redemption.</li>
<li><strong>Tank Role:</strong> She's built to absorb damage and protect allies. Make sure combat encounters threaten squishier party members so her protective instincts matter.</li>
<li><strong>Military Knowledge:</strong> Mareth recognizes military equipment, tactical formations, and Gale Force protocols. Use this to feed her information about Yackle's connections to the regime.</li>
<li><strong>NPC Reactions:</strong> Some NPCs will respect her military service. Others (especially Animals or Quadlings) will despise her for it. Both reactions are valid.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plot Hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mareth finds a list of names in Yackle's study—soldiers who participated in the purges. Her name is on it. Why was Yackle tracking them?</li>
<li>The manor contains a room filled with items taken from Animal victims. Mareth recognizes some of them from raids she led.</li>
<li>Yackle offers her a deal: "Serve me, and I'll erase your memories of the war. You could sleep peacefully again."</li>
<li>One of the house's lair actions manifests as ghosts of Animals Mareth failed to save, forcing her to confront her past literally</li>
</ul>
